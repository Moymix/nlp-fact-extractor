Openbravo

Openbravo is a commercial open-source software company. The head office of Openbravo S.L. is located in Pamplona, Spain. Openbravo has also offices in Barcelona, Paris, Mexico DF and Kolkata. The company is responsible for the development of two products: Openbravo Commerce Suite and Openbravo Business Suite. For the worldwide distribution and implementations of its software, Openbravo relies heavily on its partner network. Openbravo is a multiple-time winner of Infoworld's Bossie award for best open source software application, last awarded in August 2014.
Openbravo's roots are in the development of business administration software, first developed by two employees of the University of Navarra, Nicolas Serrano and Ismael Ciordia. They were both involved in the mid 1990s in developing the management of the university. They used emerging internet technologies while doing their work, and subsequently introduced a new approach for web applications. Their concept was realized in a new company called Tecnicia, founded in August 2001 by Serrano, Ciordia, and Aguinaga. In 2005, two management consultants, Manel Sarasa and Josep Mitjá, were asked by a venture capital company to evaluate Tecnicia and prepare a business plan for its evolution. In 2006, the two consultants joined Tecnicia as the CEO and COO respectively. Around the same time the Spanish investment company Sodena invested 6.4 million USD in the further development of the company.
In 2006 the company was renamed Openbravo and the first product launched was Openbravo ERP. The code was open-sourced on April same year. In 2007 the company announced the acquisition of LibrePOS, a Java-based Point-of-Sale (POS) application for the retail and hospitality businesses. LibrePOS was rebranded as Openbravo POS (or Openbravo Java POS). In May 2008 Openbravo attracted three more investors, Amadeus (UK), GIMV (Belgium) and Adara (Spain) for a second investment round totalling 12.5 million USD. This investment launched Openbravo as one of the leading open source companies with substantial resources to further develop its products and services.
In July 2012 Openbravo launched Openbravo for Retail, a vertical solution for the Retail industry including the Openbravo Web POS, a new POS solution that replaced the previous Openbravo Java POS. Openbravo Web POS is a web, mobile and responsive POS solution.
In March 2014, Openbravo ERP was renamed to Openbravo ERP Platform and Openbravo for Retail renamed to Openbravo Commerce Platform.
In May 2015, the Openbravo Commerce Platform and Openbravo ERP Platform were renamed to Openbravo Commerce Suite and Openbravo Business Suite. Openbravo announces its strategic focus in Retail. Openbravo also launches the Openbravo Subscription Management and Recurring Billing, a specialized solution for recurring transactions based revenue models.
, Openbravo is present in more than 60 countries through its Global Partner Network. Openbravo targets today mid-sized to large organizations seeking for a complete solution to manage the entire business or very specific solutions that help to improve existing legacy systems.
Openbravo focuses its strategy in Retail with its Openbravo Commerce Suite.
Openbravo ERP was the first product launched by Openbravo. It is a web-based ERP business solution for small and medium-sized companies that is released under the Openbravo Public License, based on the Mozilla Public License. The model for the program was originally based on the Compiere ERP program that is also open source, released under the GNU General Public License version 2. The program is among the top ten most active projects of Sourceforge as of January 2008.
Using Openbravo ERP, organizations can automate and register most common business processes. The following processes are supported: Sales, Procurement, Manufacturing, Projects, Finance, MRP and more. Numerous commercial extensions are available on the Openbravo Exchange which can be procured by users with a commercial edition of Openbravo ERP. This paid-for version offers additional functionality compared to the free Community Edition (such as: integrated administration tools, non-technical tool for updates and upgrades, access to Openbravo Exchange and a Service Level Agreement). Characteristic of the Openbravo ERP application is the green web interface through which users maintain company data in a web-browser. Openbravo can also create and export reports and data to several formats, such as PDF and Microsoft Excel.
Openbravo's Java-based architecture focuses on two development models:
These two models allow for integration with other programs and for a simple interface. Because of the application of open standards Openbravo ERP can be integrated with other open source applications like Magento webshop, Pentaho Business Intelligence, ProcessMaker BPM, Liferay Portal and SugarCRM.
In March 2014, Openbravo ERP was renamed to Openbravo ERP Platform, which was changed again to Openbravo Business Suite in May 2015.
Openbravo POS was the first POS solution offered by Openbravo. It is a Java Point-of-Sale (POS) application for retail and hospitality businesses. The application came into existence called TinaPOS. For legal reasons the application was renamed to LibrePOS. In 2007 LibrePOS was acquired by Openbravo and it is known by its current name. The program was completely integrated into Openbravo ERP. Through this integration it was possible to update stock levels, financial journals and customer data directly in the central database when a POS sales is executed in the stores. Openbravo POS can be applied using PDAs for order intake.
In July 2012 Openbravo launched its new POS solution, the Openbravo Web POS, included in the Openbravo Commerce Suite and which replaced the Openbravo Java POS.
The Openbravo Business Suite was launched in May 2015, replacing the previous Openbravo ERP Platform. It is a global management solution built on top of the Openbravo Technology Platform including horizontal ERP, CRM and BI functionality for across industries.

Sunbeam-Talbot

Sunbeam-Talbot Limited was a British motor manufacturing business. It built upmarket sports-saloon versions of Rootes Group cars from 1935 to 1954. As Clément-Talbot Limited it had made Talbot cars since 1902. It was bought by Rootes brothers in early 1935 and re-organised to make Rootes Group cars also branded Talbot. 
In 1938 after some years of consideration the Rootes brothers dropped plans to make large luxury cars branded Sunbeam, added the name Sunbeam to Talbot and put the extra name on both the cars built in North Kensington and the company building them. 
After the Second World War Sunbeam-Talbot production was resumed in London then in Spring 1946 it was moved to Rootes' new factory at Ryton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire and Clément-Talbot's North Kensington works became a Rootes administration and service centre.
Until acquired by Rootes in 1935 this North Kensington business had manufactured "thoroughbred" high quality Talbot cars and limousines. When it began in 1902 the company's name was Clément-Talbot Limited and it kept that name until 1938 when it was changed to Sunbeam-Talbot. Initially an independent public listed company on the London Stock Exchange Clément-Talbot was bought in 1919 by A Darracq and Co. Later, in 1920, Darracq bought control of Wolverhampton's Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited but kept all identities quite separate. In August 1920 Darracq was renamed S T D Motors Limited to recognise the gathering together of Sunbeam Talbot and Darracq under one ownership. 
in late 1934 S T D Motors was obliged to sell Wolverhampton's loss-making Sunbeam and North Kensington's then profit-making Talbot and they were bought by the Rootes brothers. A provisional agreement with Rootes Securities was reached in January 1935 and from that point Rootes controlled Clément-Talbot. In the summer of 1935 Rootes Securities announced they had bought Sunbeam Motor Cars. Sunbeam designs had not been brought up to date and Wolverhampton's production ended. During 1937 Humber Limited, controlled by Rootes, bought Clément-Talbot Limited and Sunbeam Motors Limited, which continued to build buses, from Rootes Securities Limited.
S T D Motors in 1922 had finally dropped Darracq from the name of its French subsidiary replacing it with Talbot. But they continued to import the French cars and when they were sold in Britain those cars were badged Darracq-Talbot or Talbot-Darracq or just Darracq. By the time this former Clément-Talbot London business was bought by Rootes the two manufacturers of Talbots no longer had any connection at all and in any case continued to manufacture wholly unrelated vehicles.
Although Talbots had been selling well the expensive London Talbot designs were dropped from production during 1936, since the new ownership had taken effect they had been steadily incorporating more and more Humber parts, and replaced with much cheaper simpler Rootes Group designs intended for a quite different much larger market. From late 1935, capitalising on the high reputation of the brandname Talbot, the Clément-Talbot North Kensington plant made mid-range upgraded versions of their Hillman and Humber cars for Rootes and branded them Talbot. To begin Talbot's well-known chief engineer and designer Georges Roesch came up with a modified Hillman Aero Minx for the October 1935 Motorshow and it was branded Talbot Ten. 
Although the intention had been to continue the Sunbeam name on a large and expensive car almost four years after Rootes bought Sunbeam it was announced Sunbeam Motors and Clément-Talbot were now combined under Clément-Talbot Limited, since renamed Sunbeam-Talbot Limited, and would continue to produce good quality cars at reasonable prices.
Until the Second World War Sunbeam-Talbot cars were made in the Clément-Talbot premises in North Kensington, London with its aging machinery. Those works repaired aero engines during the war and, though production of the prewar models resumed in London, in Spring 1946 Sunbeam-Talbot production was shifted to Rootes' new factory at Ryton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire and the North Kensington buildings became a Rootes administration and service centre.
The first two models were the handsome Sunbeam–Talbot 10 previously the Talbot Ten and the 3 Litre. They were modified Hillman-Talbots or Humber-Talbots radiatored and badged as Sunbeam-Talbots for the October 1938 Motorshow. The new 3 Litre car was a combination of then current 3 Litre Hillman Hawk later re-badged Humber Snipe in a better finished Hillman/Humber body with distinctive rear side-windows.
The Ten was launched in August 1938, and was an upgrade from the previous Talbot Ten, itself an upgrade of the Hillman Aero-Minx. Purists described the new car as "a Hillman Minx in a party frock". It had a 1185 cc sidevalve Minx unit engine with an alloy head, and a chassis that had its origins in that used in the Hillman Aero Minx. The Ten was available with four-door saloon, sports tourer bodywork and drophead coupe.
The Sunbeam-Talbot 2 Litre was introduced in 1939 and was based on the Ten, though it used the 1944 cc sidevalve engine from the Hillman 14 later Humber Hawk. Due to the advent of World War II, these models were rare. They were available in the same bodywork as the Ten. The Sunbeam-Talbot 3 Litre was available as a saloon, sports saloon, sports tourer and drophead coupé. Another new model for 1939 was the 4 Litre, a 3 Litre car with a 4086 cc sidevalve six and alloy head engine of the Humber Super Snipe. It was also supplied as a touring limousine.
These models continued to be listed after the war until 1948. However, materials were short at that time and it has been reported that "all the [3 and 4 Litre] engines were needed for the big Humbers", so that Sunbeam Talbot production was in reality virtually or entirely restricted, post-1945, to the Minx based 10 and the 2 Litre.
During the war Barlby Road repaired aero engines and built Karrier's Bantam lorries. All Sunbeam-Talbot production was suspended though Rootes continued to build the Hillman Minx and Humber Super Snipe for military use. When production resumed in 1945 only the 10 and 2-litre were continued. The 3 and 4 litre models were never revived. The following year production moved in Spring 1946 from the ex-Talbot Barlby Road London plant to the new Ryton plant opened in 1940 for the production of bombers and military vehicles under the UK government's shadow factory scheme.
Rootes were relatively quick to reintroduce the 1,944 cc and 1,185 cc Sunbeam-Talbots after the war, though the cars delivered during the first couple of years followed the designs first seen in 1939, readily identifyable by their separate headlamps. The ex-Talbot London plant became a Rootes service centre. (In 1987 the outside of the old London administration block in Barlby Road, W10, was transformed into the set for the Thames Television programme, The Bill, which was filmed there between 1987 and 1990.)
New Sunbeam-Talbot 80 and 90 designs were introduced during the summer of 1948 and built at the new Ryton plant. Both had the same new streamlined design with flowing front wings into which were integrated headlamps in a manner reminiscent of the front of a fighter plane, a shape that would have been all too familiar to potential buyers at the time. The designer, Ted White, acknowledged had been his inspiration. The 80 was again fitted with an overhead valve version of the old 10 and Minx engine. The 90 had a modified version of the Humber Hawk ohv 4-cylinder 2-litre engine. Both were available with saloon bodywork from British Light Steel Pressings or drophead coupe bodywork by Thrupp & Maberly. The small-engined postwar austerity model Sunbeam-Talbot 80 was discontinued in 1950.
The 90 continued in production renamed 90 MK II with a new chassis and independent front suspension. The headlamps were raised by three inches to meet American regulations and the front driving lamps were replaced with a pair of small air intake grilles. The 90 MK II also had an enlarged OHV engine with 2267 cc. The MK IIA arrived in 1952, the main update on this model was the removal of the rear wheel spats.
After twenty years of potential confusion with the French Talbot that name was dropped in 1954 and the final revision was badged Sunbeam instead. It was given much larger front air intake grilles and three air outlet portholes just below each side at the back of the bonnet. The engine now developed , amazing compared to the that the, admittedly smaller swept volume, very first 90 achieved. In the 1952 Alpine Rally cars won three Coupes des Alpes, Manufacturers Team Prize, 1st 2nd and third places in the 2 to 3-litre class and a special cup for an outstanding performance. A name had been found for a new model.
Production of the first postwar style finally ended in 1957.
The first Alpine is a two-seater sports-variant its body specially made by Thrupp & Maberly from the standard 2¼-litre 4-seater drophead coupé. Very successful in motor rallying in Europe —rallying was then a greater spectator sport than GP racing— its production was from 1953 to 1955. The day before its announcement it was awarded the RAC Dewar Trophy for setting new speed and endurance records on the "Jabbeke" autoroute and the Montlhéry circuit.
On its first competitive outing, the 1953 Coupe des Alpes, the new car won the Coupe des Dames (Sheila Van Damm) and, without loss of any marks, four Coupes des Alpes driven by Stirling Moss, John Fitch, G Murray-Frame and Sheila Van Damm.
Under Rootes Sunbeams and Talbots with the unified name continued competition in some motorsports. The two seater Alpine variants proved to be very effective rally vehicles with notable International successes by drivers Sheila van Damm and Stirling Moss. Cars competed in and won numerous international rallies, most notably the 1955 Monte Carlo Rally. They concentrated mainly on the more popular rallying rather than other competition.
Sunbeam Rapier is a Raymond Loewy designed two-door hardtop variant of the Hillman Minx available from October 1955. Later sold as a convertible it displayed the Sunbeam-Talbot signature rear side-window on its first hardtop version. 
In 1967 it was replaced by a two-door fastback version of the Hillman Hunter which stayed in production until 1976.
Series I. From 1959 to 1968 a quite different 1½-litre car with the same name and an up-to-date prominently finned shape for its body was made on a modified Hillman Husky chassis. A 4¼ Litre (later 4¾ Litre) Ford V8 powered variant was sold under the name Tiger. The Tiger showed little change in external appearance.
Low spec Rapier. Under Chrysler ownership and continuing the old Sunbeam-Talbot Ten and Sunbeam Rapier formula a two-door fastback variant of the Hillman Hunter Minx replacement was sold under the Alpine name from 1969 to 1975. Unusually this Sunbeam was a simplified downmarket version of the main Sunbeam Rapier car.
The Q-car, Sunbeam Tiger, is a Sunbeam Alpine with a 4¼-litre, later 4¾-litre, Ford V8 engine transplant.

Sakowitz

Sakowitz was a chain of family-owned department stores based in Houston, Texas, United States. The store was founded by two brothers, Tobias and Simon Sakowitz, in Galveston, Texas in 1902. Other family members were working in the cotton mills in Galveston. The two brothers, Simon and Tobias, began a peddler business, taking orders and delivering clothes on a bicycle to the many merchant seamen in Galveston at that time. Eventually, the chain expanded to thirteen locations, of which ten were in Texas.
L. J. Hooker, an Australian retail development firm, purchased the Sakowitz chain in 1988 so that a location could be opened at Forest Fair Mall (now Cincinnati Mall) in Forest Park, Ohio and Fairfield, Ohio. Due, in part, to the fact that Cincinnati was an untested market, the mall straddled two counties (Hamilton and Butler) and that the Australian real estate market tanked, Forest Fair Mall failed. The location of the complex was also in a very middle-class area and having both high and low end stores reside in the same mall proved to be too much.
The Sakowitz chain was liquidated in 1990 and its stores closed. The Sakowitz name has survived in the form of Sakowitz Furs, a fur dealer with one store in Houston, owned by Jerry Gronauer.
Sakowitz was founded by brothers Tobias and Simon Sakowitz, the sons of a Ukrainian immigrant, in 1902. The first location was in Galveston, Texas, with a second following in Houston, Texas fifteen years later. The location in Galveston was closed in 1917 and consolidated into the Houston store.
By 1929, the original Houston store on 308 Main Street had relocated to the Gulf Building at 720 Main Street; this store was subsequently relocated even further down Main Street. Eventually, the chain grew to several locations throughout Houston, including a suburban location at Westheimer Road at Post Oak and one in Nassau Bay across from NASA. With the increasing popularity of shopping malls, several mall-based locations were also added, including one each in the states of Arizona and Oklahoma. By the late 1980s, however, Sakowitz had scaled back operations, closing all but the Houston stores.
In the late 1980s, Australian developer L. J. Hooker proposed an upscale mall in suburban Cincinnati, Ohio, to be named Forest Fair Mall. Hooker's plans called for Sakowitz to be one of the mall's anchor stores, along with B. Altman and Bonwit Teller, two upscale chains based in New York City. In 1988, Hooker purchased controlling interest in all three chains so that they could open locations at the new mall; however, the chains proved too upscale for the Cincinnati market, and were subsequently sold off.
The Sakowitz chain was then auctioned off by L. J. Hooker, and all other locations were closed as well. The only remnant of the Sakowitz name is a Sakowitz Furs shop located in Houston, and that is owned by Jerry Gronauer.

Jump Associates

Jump Associates is a strategy and innovation consulting firm with offices in San Mateo, CA and New York, NY. The company was founded in 1998 by CEO Dev Patnaik, Udaya Patnaik, Neal Moore, and Robert Becker. Its business was launched with a project for the office furniture company Steelcase, which continued to be a client in years to come.
Since its founding, Jump has grown to a 50-person, multimillion-dollar company. 
Jump Associates takes what it has termed a “hybrid thinking” approach to business strategy, with the goal of helping clients to identify new markets, develop new sources of revenue, and reinvent existing categories. Jump believes that this hybrid approach at the intersection of organizational culture, design thinking and business allows them to take a broader view of issues and find new opportunities that might otherwise be missed.
Underlying the hybrid thinking approach is an emphasis on using empathy to help companies better understand what’s going on in the world. In the book “Wired to Care,” Patnaik discusses customer empathy and how “the ‘needsfinding’ exercises that industrial designers do that seem so focused on objects and products are really about people and empathy.” Patnaik contends that empathy for customers enables companies to create offerings that are more likely to succeed by aligning their work directly with people’s needs.
Jump’s work is built on the premise that creativity is an expertise, and it is possible to create conditions for cultivating innovative ideas and be trained to brainstorm. The firm uses a variety of methods including improv-inspired brainstorming, anthropological analysis of video footage of target users, and mock business pitches. The company also relies on neuroscience and the latest team-building research and methods to improve effectiveness and camaraderie. For example, new employees take learning and skills-assessment tests, which are used and talked about on a regular basis to improve team performance.
Jump’s services encompass various ways to approach brainstorming and generating ideas to solve what they term “ambiguous problems,” combining elements of management consulting, design, and selling “the art of innovation.” Organizations may hire Jump to “think on [their] behalf,” or hire Jump to teach them how to generate better ideas through a series of training sessions.
The “ambiguous problems” Jump has helped companies to solve include helping P&G study the future of water, and working with Target to reframe its back-to-school lines by focusing on students’ mindsets and hopes rather than specific product trends.
Jump serves clients in various industries, including but not limited to high tech, consumer packaged goods, retail, hospitality, and travel, and has specialized practices in healthcare and financial services. Its clients have included GE, Samsung, Target, FedEx, 3M, Nike, HP, Harley Davidson, General Mills, NBC, Sony, and Stanford Medical Center. Jump’s collaboration with the Stanford School of Medicine on helping its medical staff achieve work-life balance won the Alfred P. Sloan Award for Excellence in Faculty Career Flexibility. The work involved conducting video ethnographies and interviews of academic doctors and other staff.
Jump’s organizational culture emphasizes teamwork and “considerate collaboration” in service of creativity. For example, all employees, known as “Jumpsters,” meet every morning for a standing meeting called a “scrum,” a quick get-together to share company news and updates, yoga-like exercises, and brain-stimulating games. Jump employees occasionally do “affinity exercises,” where employees ask their coworkers to say one thing they like about each other. There is also a “no zinger” policy banning Jumpsters from making demeaning or hurtful comments about other employees. Jump occasionally uses a coach to help employees with any teamwork issues, such as improving communications or conflict resolution. As part of the collaborative culture, all employees, including senior management, sit in open “neighborhoods” of five or six workers. Jump also emphasizes injecting energy, whether that’s for employees, clients, or any visitors.
The Jump office, or “JumpSpace,” was designed with Michael Fazio of the architecture firm Archideas to foster creativity and encourage employees to bounce ideas off of each other. The office includes various forms of workspaces to account for different working styles and promote informal social interaction, including a café, an open staircase, zen room, and a performance space with a garage door. The office has a flexible infrastructure for people to easily move walls, desks, and whiteboards as needed.
In 2008, Jump Associates was recognized as one of the Top Small Workplaces by the Wall Street Journal.

Robeez

Robeez is the premier apparel, socks and clothing brand for babies, infants and toddlers sold at specialty and department stores as well as online. Robeez is headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States and is a division of McCubbin Hosiery LLC.
The Robeez baby shoe company was started by Sandra Wilson in the basement of her Vancouver, Canada home. While being a stay-at-home-mom after a recent layoff, Wilson was unable to find baby shoes that would stay on her son’s feet properly, she came up with an idea for a pair of soft-soled leather booties that would not slip off. The suede non-slip sole allowed her toddler, named Robert, to walk without sliding and the elastic ankle band ensured the shoes didn't easily fall off. The inspiration for the Robeez name came from her son. Now owned and produced by [McCubbin] Hosiery, LLC, a 60 year industry veteran, Robeez sets the trends for children's footwear, socks and apparel as we create products that parents and babies love.

Libyan Investment Authority

The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) (المؤسسة الليبية للاستثمار) is a government-managed sovereign wealth fund and holding company headquartered in Tripoli, Libya. It was established on August 28, 2006, by Decree 208 of the General People's Committee of Libya (GPC), after the lifting of economic sanctions that had previously precluded foreign investment in Libya. The LIA oversees and manages investments in various areas including agriculture, real estate, infrastructure, oil and gas and in shares and bonds. It is Africa’s largest sovereign wealth fund. The fund is a member of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds and is therefore signed up to the Santiago Principles on best practice in managing sovereign wealth funds.
On 15 August 2016, the Presidential Council of the Government of National Accord (GNA) appointed an Interim Steering Committee to temporarily administer and steer the LIA. It has the privileges and terms of reference of the Board of Directors and Chairman with a view to safeguard the normal administration of the company.
The Steering Committee is chaired by Dr. Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed. The other members are Eng. Abdulazeez Khaled Ali, Mr. Alhadi Najimeddin Kabar, Mr. Khaled Khalifa Hassan Altaher and Mr. Ahmed Abdullah Amar.
On 17 August 2016, the governments of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a Joint Statement welcoming the appointment of the Steering Committee and underlining the GNA to “exercise sole and effective oversight” of the Libyan institutions including the LIA.
Abdulmagid Breish, former BoD Chairman, disputes Hassan Bouhadi’s authority as chairman of the Board of Directors of the LIA. In 2014, Breish stepped down, replaced in the interim by Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, a former Libyan Minister for Oil and Gas, pending an inquiry under Libya’s Political and Administrative Isolation Law (through decision No.659 of 2014), until a permanent chairman was put in place.
As of 29 September 2014 when the Board of Trustees removed Mr Ben Yezza from his role (Resolution 7 of 29 September 2014) and appointed Mr Bouhadi as chairman (Resolution 8).
Breish appealed against his isolation before the Appeal Court of Tripoli. On 13 April 2015, the Libyan Court of Appeal stated that the Political and Administrative Isolation Law did not apply to Breish – he claims this led to his reinstatement as Chairman and CEO of the LIA on 18 May 2015. 
However this decision does not reinstate him, nor does it suggest that any tenure he may have had in the past be reinstated. Mr Breish could have sought to be reinstated and made himself available to the Board of Trustees, but he has not yet done so.
Deeply rooted in the democratic structures of Libya, the LIA is overseen by the Libyan Government and is managed within strict governance processes, accountable to that government.
The Board of Trustees of LIA is:
Previous Chairmen include Muhammad Layas, the LIA’s first chairman, who had previously been chairman and general manager of the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank; Mohsen Derregia (April 2012 - March 2013), who was asked to leave, and replaced short-term by Ali Mohamed Salem Hibri, deputy governor of the Central Bank of Libya. 
The Steering Committee is composed of five members, including the chairman. The current Steering Committee Members are:
The LIA is deeply embedded within democratic structures of Libya and it mandate is defined by Law 13 which became statute in 2010. Law No. 13 of 2010 sets out the LIA’s continuing mandate. The Libyan Investment Authority (“LIA”) was established in 2006 and is regulated under Law No. 13 of 2010 (“Law No. 13”), which continues to be in full force and effect as a matter of Libyan law.
Under Law No. 13, the LIA is composed of:
a. The Board of Trustees, being the ultimate governance body with oversight and control of the LIA. The Board of Trustees comprises: the Prime Minister (as Chairman); the ministers for Planning, Finance, Economy and Trade; the Governor of the Central Bank of Libya; and a number of experts. This structure was established by Decree No. 2 of 2014, the Council of Ministers, the executive branch of the Libyan Government appointed in accordance with the governmental mandate of the elected House of Representatives.
b. The Board of Directors, being the competent body to oversee the management of the LIA (articles 10 and 11 of Law No. 13). The LIA Board of Directors is to be made up of seven members, including a Chairman. They must be appointed by resolution of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Directors oversees three subcommittees, (Nomination & Compensation, Governance, and Audit & Risk Committee), each of which have an agreed mandate of responsibilities and undertake frequent reporting back to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors frequently report to the Board of Trustees.
The LIA was established in August 2006 to manage Libya’s mounting oil revenue surplus. The LIA now counts the assets of the Libyan Foreign Investment Company (LAFICO), established in 1982, and Oilinvest, founded in 1988, in its portfolio. The value of the LIA is widely quoted as 70 billion but the LIA's September 2010 management information report valued its own investment portfolio at $64 billion and the Wall Street Journal quoted a value of $53 billion in June 2010.
The LIA is headquartered in Tripoli.
On May 29, 2007, during a visit to Muammar Gaddafi by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, British Petroleum (BP) signed a $900 million exploration and production agreement with the Libyan National Oil Company. The agreement, which will likely involve an estimated USD $2 billion in investment, covers three massive, largely unexplored tracts. The NOC signed the agreement with the LIA as BP’s 15% partner in a production sharing agreement (PSA).
The LIA also manages the Economic and Social Development Fund (ESDF). Established in February 2006, the ESDF manages substantial assets in Libya across a number of sectors to benefit Libya’s poor. The LIA’s share in BP’s PSA provides a direct conduit via which oil wealth can be recycled. However, some Libya experts believe that the presence of two state-owned companies in BP’s deal reflects divisions and tensions at the executive level in Libya, particularly over who controls the oil wealth.
During August 2007, LIA agreed to establish a Libyan-Qatari joint investment fund for $2 billion equally with the Qatar Investment Corporation (QIC). Also, the General People's Congress secretary signed two agreements in Doha on July 2007 to establish a Libyan-Qatari Bank between QIC and the Central Bank of Libya. An agreement was also signed to establish a joint company for real estate development between Al-Diar real estate investment company (Qatar) and the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company.
In July, 2008, the LIA bought a share in the Dutch-Belgian bank of Fortis, which needed additional funds to maintain solvency. The LIA did not confirm the investment, since they were not required by Dutch or Belgian law to do so. However, later that week, the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos admitted that the situation 'had his attention, as well as that of the Dutch Central Bank', considering previous Libyan involvement in international terrorism.
As of June 2010, Lafico held 7.5% of the total shares of Italian football club Juventus.
Between January and June 2008, the LIA paid $1.3 billion for options on a basket of currencies and options on six stocks (Citigroup Inc., UniCredit SpA, Banco Santander, Allianz, Électricité de France and Eni SpA) via Goldman Sachs. By February 2010, the value of these investments was 0.025 billion - a 98% loss.
In May 2011, "The Washington Post" detailed the holdings of the LIA. Despite a severe lack of transparency, the LIA saw an astonishing influx of foreign investment after Libya was removed from the U.S.'s list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2006, thereby lifting previously imposed economic sanctions. "The Post" reported that investment in Libya "occurred with encouragement from U.S. officials, who wanted to reward Gaddafi for pledging to honor international law, disavow terrorism and compensate relatives of victims of the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing:"
As of Q1 of 2010, the LIA held approximately US$56 billion in assets around the world, broken down as follows:
By May 2011, U.S. regulators had frozen $37 billion of the LIA's assets there, including $29 billion in a single bank. The head of the London School of Economics resigned after it was revealed that he had served as an informal adviser to the LIA and accepted a donation from the fund to the school. UniCredit, Italy's largest bank, also froze some of Gaddafi's assets.
Following a validation and evaluation assessment undertaken by Deloitte for the Board of Directors in 2012, the LIA portfolio was valued at $67 billion as of December 31, 2012. The mandate for the LIA based on Law 13 of 2010 to the Board of Directors is to preserve, protect and grow the sovereign wealth investments.
Abdulmagid Breish has consistently called for the UN to maintain its freeze over the majority of the LIA's assets under UN Security Council Resolution 1970 of 26 February 2011. Approximately 85% of he LIA's assets remain frozen to safeguard them against potential misappropriation and corruption. These sanctions were originally requested by the National Transitional Council shortly after the fall of the Gaddafi regime to protect such assets from theft.
Breish has insisted on maintaining the UN position that Libyan assets must be frozen until a Unity Government emerges and asserts control. Bouhadi, by contrast, has repeatedly sough to unfreeze the assets, stating that said he would appeal to the UN, the US and the EU.
In 2011, Ali Tarhouni, minister of financial and oil affairs for the rebel National Transitional Council, appointed Mahmoud Badi, formerly a civil servant under Gaddafi, to investigate the Libyan Investment Authority. In August 2011, Badi found "misappropriation, misuse and misconduct of funds" with $2.9 billion missing from the LIA. Mr Badi's report was the first in a series of reports by Gaddafi era technocrats claiming large losses and misconduct. Mr Badi himself was a Gaddafi era technocrat and was removed soon after his claims were made. He now heads the Libyan Economic and Social Fund.
Internal Management Reports were leaked to the Press by sacked staff in June 2010 and September 2012 which showed the Libyan Investment Authority had suffered much smaller losses than expected compared to the huge losses suffered by many sovereign wealth funds in the fallout of the 2008 crash.
The "Financial Times" interviewed Gaddafi era appointees and directors of LIA, bankers who had never done business with the LIA, and former Gaddafi Libyan officials and reported more rumour and innuendo with no hard evidence generally making vague claims of mismanagement. Farhat Bengdara, a Gaddafi appointee, the former governor of the Central Bank of Libya and member of LIA's board of trustees claimed that there was a "clear lack of governance at the LIA" surprising since he been on its governance board of trustees until the revolution came. On Bengdara's recommendation Sami Rais (another Gaddafi era appointment)had been made chief executive of LIA in October 2009. Rais and Bengdara were subsequently sacked by the new governments of Libya. The accountancy firm KPMG had provided reports and audit in 2010 which showed the LIA asset position steadily improving and made no suggestions of corruption or wrongdoing by any LIA staff member.
As of December 2012 the Libyan Investment Authority following the Deloitte validation and evaluation report and the commitment to meeting the governance of mandate outlined in Law 13, the LIA appears to be operating normally and no responsible investigation has demonstrated any real substantiated evidence of corruption or malfeasance.
In early 2014, Breish initiated legal proceedings on behalf of the LIA against Goldman Sachs and Société Générale S.A to recover billions of dollars lost through improper transactions done in their dealing with the LIA during the Gaddafi Regime. 
The LIA appointed the English law firm Enyo Law to pursue litigations. Enyo law was forced to step aside in April 2015 but was re-instated in July 2015 when the English High Court approved the LIA's application to appoint BDO LLP (UK) as interim receivers and Enyo Law were reappointed as solicitors in the litigations.
In December 2015, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2259 welcoming the signing of Libyan Political Agreement and the emergence of a Tripoli based Presidency Council (PC) and Government of National Accord (GNA). 
On 30 March 2016 , the PC and GNA arrived in Tripoli. By mid-April British, French and Spanish ambassadors had returned to Tripoli to reopen their embassies, and foreign ministers from the UK, France and Germany had visited Tripoli to express their support for the PC and GNA. Italian and Spanish ambassadors then followed suit shortly after.
Breish has supported the establishment of a Presidency Council (PC) and Government of National Accord (GNA) since 3 April 2016. In a statement Breish welcomed the PC and GNA, stating that "The LIA reaffirms its readiness to fully cooperate with the Government of National Accord in providing all relevant data, reports and support".

Interline Brands

Interline Brands, Inc., headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the largest wholesale distributors and direct marketers of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) products for non-industrial businesses in the United States. Interline Brands distributes a broad range of products such as HVAC, janitorial supplies, plumbing supplies and security supplies.
Interline Brands was established in 1978 formerly known as Wilmar Industries. Gradually Interline Brands diversified their customer base through the acquisitions of Sexauer, Trayco, Barnett, U.S. Lock, Learn Gas Products, Maintenance USA, Hardware Express and janitorial supply distributors AmSan, CleanSource and JanPak. In 2015 Interline Brands merged five of its janitorial brands into one unified brand called SupplyWorks. On July 22, 2015 The Home Depot acquired Interline Brands for $1.6 billion.
The origin of Interline Brands first began with Wilmar Supply Company in 1978. Wilmar was a hardware store in Collingswood, New Jersey founded by William (Bill) Green and his father Martin Green. To expand its business beyond retail it began selling MRO products to area apartment complexes and then expanded geographically by distributing to multi-family housing businesses. Wilmar went public in 1996 and purchased 14 regional competing businesses before acquiring the Sexauer Group, a well-known and established distributor of plumbing product to institutions, in 1999. A leveraged buyout in May, 2000 took the company private in preparation for the next stage of growth. Wilmar acquired Barnett, Inc. because the two businesses were very similar, but each targeted a different customer base. Wilmar's customers performed facility maintenance, while Barnett sold to locksmiths, retail hardware and contractors.
Wilmar Industries acquired Barnett in September 2000 and renamed the umbrella company, Interline Brands in June 2001 Their guiding principle was to "change as little as possible about the way our customers currently do business with us". 
Each of the businesses (including Sexauer) retained their identity from the customer's point of view, including salesmen, telephone numbers, products, etc. They realized the value of each company's brand, and preserved sales/marketing relationships built over the years. What did change was behind the scenes in accounting, distribution and administration, realizing economies of scale. In 2000, Interline had a total of 76 distribution centers, which they were able to shrink to 56 in 2004. A national distribution center in Nashville, Tennessee was opened in 2001, reducing the inventory required at the local distribution centers and improving delivery times. In late 2004 Interline went public as NYSE:IBI but was later delisted in September 2012 to become privatized.
To further expand the business of Interline the firm acquired several distributors of cleaning supplies. It first acquired American Sanitary or AmSan in May 2006 for $127.5 million alogn with AmSan's own line of products called Renown. Renown has a large diverse products base such as toilet paper, paper towels, brooms, and cleaning agents. In the 1990s AmSan became a conglomerate by buying 44 independent janitor and sanitary distributors. Some of AmSan's acquisitions are AmSan Eve, AmSan Vonachen-Elton, AmSan Nogg Chemical & Paper, and AmSan West. In 2002 Michael Mulhern became CEO of AmSan. Mulhern moved the headquarters of AmSan from Raleigh, North Carolina to Chicago, Illinois. Under Mulhern AmSan underwent a series of reforms dedicated to increasing profitability. AmSan turned over 40% of its top 35 executives, downsized its office operations and downsized under-performing distribution centers. By 2005 AmSan had revenues totalling $300 million. American Capital invested $25 million in the recapitalization of AmSan in 2005. AmSan West, which has operations in Sacramento and Los Angeles, was not acquired by Interline Brands. In 2008 AmSan established a sales and distribution territory in Columbus, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Nashville. In 2009 a showroom and walk-in store was established in Fort Myers, Florida.
Cleansource, a regional distributor of JanSan products, was acquired in October 2010 for $60.1 million. CleanSource was founded in 1956 in San Jose, California. It distributes janitorial, food service supplies, and MRO products. Customers of CleanSource consists of healthcare, education and institutional facilities. In 2010 CleanSource generated around $115 million in sales.
A regional supplier of cleaning and packaging solutions called JanPak was acquired in 2012 for $82 million. JanPak was founded in 1945 in Bluefield, West Virginia by James Shott, H. I. Shott, Jr., James Tilson, L. M. Kerley Sr. and B. L. Early. It was first called Paper Supply Company until 2000 when the name changed to JanPak Inc. Mike Shott, James Shott's grandson, was serving as company chair of the board directors at the time of the name change to JanPak. The name changed to JanPak to unite its sister branches such as Charlotte Paper Company or Greenville Paper Company who each were known by a different name.
On March 16, 2015 Interline merged AmSan, CleanSource, JanPak, Trayco, and Sexauer into a new national brand called SupplyWorks. AF Lighting was also sold to Almo Corporation in March 2015 because lighting was a minimal part of the business of Interline Brands.
The Home Depot acquired Interline Brands in July 2015 for $1.6 billion from P2 Capital Partners, Goldman Sachs' private equity arm, and the management of Interline Brands. The acquisition of Interline Brands allows The Home Depot access to expand its business to the multi-family sector, hospitality and industrial area. Craig Menear, CEO of The Home Depot, says that the purchase gives The Home Depot more opportunity to expand in the Maintenance, repair, and operations sector that was previously not successful. In January 2016 Michael Grebe retired leaving Kenneth Sweder as the new CEO.
The company staffs 30 showrooms throughout North America with 70 strategically placed distribution centers stocking over 30,000 products under the brands Wilmar, Barnett, SupplyWorks, Hardware Express, Maintenance USA, U.S. Lock, and Copperfield.
Its customer base includes: 
The Interline companies offer plumbing, electrical, HVAC, security hardware and janitorial products, but nearly half of Interline's sales are plumbing products. Their goal is to provide premium products at competitive prices with same or next-day delivery. "Get It Right. Get It Now." is the company slogan. 
Products are sold using multiple channels: direct sales by national account representatives or field representatives, telephone sales, customer service representatives, direct marketing through flyers & catalogs, "pro centers", vendor managed inventory, and Internet-based service. Most Interline Distribution Centers include a customer center for over-the-counter sales which Barnett customers prefer. In markets with a sizeable customer base but no distribution center, Interline would look for an existing single-location supply house that could be purchased and turned into a "pro center"—a small contractor showroom and pickup facility that stocks high turnover items. Next day delivery is shipped using Interline Brands delivery trucks. Third party carriers such as UPS and Saia is also used for customers outside of the next day service area. There are also will call or pick up locations at most Interline Brands locations. Products can be purchased online or through a sales representative.
Interline Brands contains eight brand names to serve contractors, specialty distributors, housing maintenance and janitorial needs. The products from these brands are stored in distribution centers and contractor showrooms in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.
In Ontario Interline Brands has a distribution center in Mississauga under the Barnett and Sexauer brand. Sexauer, a brand of Interline Brands, had a distribution center in Edmonton and Toronto.
Interline Brands distributes its Wilmar, U.S. Lock and SupplyWorks brands to United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Barnett has a distribution center in Bayamon, Puerto Rico and is referred to as Barnett of the Caribbean.
Wilmar Supply Company was founded in 1978 by William Green and Martin Green in Collingswood, New Jersey as a hardware store. Wilmar expanded its retail business by selling MRO products to apartment complexes and multi-family housing. In the 1986 William Green became CEO of Wilmar and in 1993 William bought out Martin's interests in Wilmar. The annual revenues of Wilmar escalated from $24.52 million in 1993 to $100.64 million in 1997. In the same year The Pier-Angeli Group, Lindley Plumbing and Supply Company and Management Supply Company was acquired by Wilmar as part of its strategy of expanding to new markets through the fragmented industry. On January 24, 1996 Wilmar went public and raise over $47 million. Wilmar expanded into the institutional and lodging facilities by acquiring Sexauer and Trayco in December 1999 for $85 million. Wilmar also acquired Ace Maintenance Mart USA, Inc. in 1999.
On January 24, 1996 Wilmar went public as (NASDAQ:WLMR) and raise over $47 million. Wilmar expanded into the institutional and lodging facilities by acquiring Sexauer and Trayco in December 1999 for $85 million. Wilmar went private in May 2000 by investment groups that include Parthenon Capital, The Chase Manhattan Bank (now known as JPMorgan Chase Bank) as trustee for First Plaza Group Trust (a GM Pension Fund), Sterling Investment Partners, BancBoston Capital and Svoboda Capital, LLC. William Green still retained the position of CEO William Green. In 2000 Wilmar, based in Moorestown, New Jersey, purchased Barnett, Inc. for $214 million. Wilmar and its acquisitions became an umbrella company under the name Interline Brands in 2001. Michael J. Grebe became CEO of Wilmar in January 2002 and continued to be CEO until January 1, 2016. After Wilmar acquired Barnett the two companies began a program of integrating operations into streamlining the distribution operations. The logo of Interline Brands is colored after Wilmar with red, black and white.

Barnett was established in 1958 as Barnett Tube Fitting and Valve Company by the Leonard Barnett family. The initial purpose of Barnett was to supply copper tubing to customers through its catalog. In 1972 Barnett changed to Barnett Brass & Copper. Barnett was acquired by Waxman Industries for $12.5 million giving Barnett access to the mail-order market. Waxman Industries formed Barnett, Inc. in 1993 and two years later it reached $100 million in sales.

The rebranding makes SupplyWorks easier to grow under one brand instead of multiple brands. President & COO Kenneth Sweder says on the creation of SupplyWorks, "The launch of SupplyWorks punctuates the growth strategy we've been pursuing to build a leading share position in the highly fragmented institutional facilities maintenance end market. Supply stands for products and the Works represents everything the products do for the customer. The products of SupplyWorks produces $850 million making up half of Interline Brands annual revenue.
The products of SupplyWorks consists of a variety of cleaning solutions and janitorial supplies. There are over 3,000 brand supply partners of SupplyWorks such as Georgia-Pacific, Dart Container, 3M, Diversey, Kimberly-Clark and Spartan. SupplyWorks also has products unrelated to janitorial brands such as corrugated boxes, disposable food packaging and MRO products. Products can be purchased online or through a sales representative.
SupplyWorks has over 68 distribution centers throughout the United States along with 100 delivery vehicles. Next day delivery is shipped using Supplyworks delivery trucks. Third party carriers such as UPS is also used for customers outside of the next day service area. There are also will call or pick up locations at most Supplyworks locations. The customer base of SupplyWorks is property management, conctractors, health care and educational facitilies.
After the rebranding of JanPak, CleanSource, Trayco, AmSan and Sexauer into SupplyWorks the new company increased in revenue with expanded customers. The announcement of SupplyWorks was made at EverBank Field complete with fireworks and a promotional video on the scoreboard to jumpstart marketing of its new brand. CEO Michael Grebe says that "it's easier to grow one brand instead of five." The SupplyWorks brand is also advertised on the scoreboard during Jacksonville Jaguars games. By now being under one unified brand SupplyWorks can now nationalize in the commercial building supply business. The AmSan brand Renown is still distributed by SupplyWorks and marketed under Interline Brands.
The website of SupplyWorks allows customers to place orders and research products. Customers can create bin labels, custom catalog and a favorites list. SupplyWorks also has a mobile app allowing customers to have easy access to products.
Interline Brands has several exclusive products streamlined under Wilmar, Barnett, Maintenance USA, Hardware Express, US Lock and SupplyWorks.
Renown are private-label products owned by Interline Brands since the acquisition of AmSan in 2006. Renown consists of a wide array of cleaning and janitorial products. Trash bags, paper towels, toilet paper, Cleaning agents, rubber gloves and mops make up the majority of Renown products. It is currently marketed under the SupplyWorks brand.

KaleidoScoops

KaleidoScoops is an American chain of ice cream shops. It was founded in 1999 by a co-operative of former Baskin-Robbins franchisees after the termination of their franchises. The chain comprises more than sixty locations in twenty states throughout the U.S.
KaleidoScoops was formed in 1999 by several former Baskin-Robbins franchisees after the latter company terminated approximately 200 domestic franchisee agreements in Southern markets they deemed "nonstrategic." Over forty of the former franchisees united to form the new company, KaleidoScoops, which operates as a cooperative based in Austin, Texas. These people formed the co-op to improve the quality of the ice cream, lower the cost of overhead and pass the savings on to longtime neighborhood customers.
The first stores to be converted experienced an initial drop in sales of about 20 percent. But as customers tried the new ice cream, sales rose above pre-conversion amounts. Between 2000 and 2003, KaleidoScoops doubled in size, with many of its members entering the cooperative with no prior experience owning ice cream shops. These new owners brought in fresh perspectives and new ideas to Kaleidoscoops that have allowed the company to expand into 20 states. Kaleidoscoops is still expanding and is still having franchisees convert from other ice cream chains.
The co-op takes no percentage of sales revenue, although it does levy a $2 surcharge per each tub of ice cream, which made up the bulk of its earnings in 2001. Even with the surcharge, ice cream costs about 30% less for store owners buying from KaleidoScoops than from Baskin-Robbins, according to Fletcher.

G.Communication

G.Communication, also abbreviated as G.com, is a Japanese kabushiki kaisha based in Nagoya, Japan. The company is an operator of restaurant chains, "juku" (cram schools), and "eikaiwa" (language schools).
G.Communication Group was started in Aichi, Japan. Masaki Inayoshi first opened a private cram school in 1994 called "Ganbaru Gakuen". G.Communication grew rapidly due to aggressive mergers and acquisitions. Headed by Inayoshi, the firm expanded its business by purchasing shares of restaurant chains, including sushi chain Heiroku in July 2005 and Yakinikuya Sakai Co. in May 2007.
The aggressive strategy has at times caught the attention of the government. In October 2006, the Financial Services Agency ordered G.Communication to pay a ¥390,000 fine for insider trading after purchasing shares of one of its subsidiaries that was planning a capital increase before the information became public. In 2006, it acquired all of the shares of an English-language school chain in Hokkaido with some 50 schools, merging it into G.Education, part of the group.
In November 2007, G.Communication took over Nova after it filed for bankruptcy in November 2007. Following the April 2010 bankruptcy of GEOS, G.Communication also took over 230 schools owned by the company.
On 1 October 2010, Nova's 490 locations nationwide and GEOS's 167 were sold by G.Education to Inayoshi Capital, owned by G.Education founder Masaki Inayoshi.
As of February 1, 2012 Nova was sold to Jibun Mirai Associe Co Ltd. G.Communication still owns some GEOS operations outside Japan, located in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei, and Thailand.
Criticism of the company has been made regarding: 'disorganization and putting profit before quality and teacher's rights'.

<doc id="14702580" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14702580" title="Vector Graphic">
Vector Graphic

Vector Graphic was an early microcomputer company founded in 1976, the same year as Apple Computer, during the pre-IBM PC era, along with the NorthStar Horizon, IMSAI, and MITS Altair.
The first product was a memory card for the S-100 bus. A full microcomputer using the Z80 microprocessor, the Vector 1, was introduced in 1977. There were several Vector Graphic models produced. The Vector 1+ had a floppy disk drive. The Vector Graphic 3 had a fixed keyboard housed anchoring a combined screen terminal and CPU case. The Vector Graphic 4 was a transitional 8-bit and 16-bit hybrid model.
Although primarily used with the CP/M operating system, the Vector 3 ran several others including OASIS, Micropolis Disk Operating System (MDOS), and Micropolis Z80 Operating System (MZOS).
Early Vector Graphic models used the Micropolis floppy disk controller and Micropolis floppy disk drives. Later models were designed with the integrated floppy drive-hard drive controller and used Tandon floppy drives. Almost all used unusual 100-track per inch 5 ¼-inch floppy drives and 16-sector hard sector media. Some models included 8-inch floppy drives and hard disk drives.
Vector Graphic sales peaked in 1982, by which time the company was publicly traded, at $36 million. It faltered soon after due to several factors. The introduction of the IBM PC in August 1981 shifted the market and smaller players lost momentum. The Vector 4 was accidentally pre-announced in April 1982, the same month that founder and chief hardware designer Robert Harp left the company after a dispute with co-founder (and wife) Lore Harp over control of the company. The early announcement of the Vector 4, which had a separate keyboard tethered to the computer (as opposed to a combined keyboard and terminal) resulted in a sharp decrease in sales of the Vector 3 as customers delayed purchases up to six months until the new product was available. In addition, the company had decided to use the CP/M operating system in the Vector 4, which they considered a superior operating system than MDOS; management recognized the nature of their gamble, as IBM would move the market in a different direction if it elected to use the DOS operating system for their competing product, the IBM 8080. The gamble did not pay off, and by the end of 1984 Lore Harp was gone and venture capital investors took over. By summer 1985 only three dozen employees remained, down from a peak of 425 workers in 1982. Ultimately, the Vector Graphic headquarters and assembly factory, across from a 17-person company (Amgen) and next to the 101 freeway, was converted into a Home Depot store. Chapter 11 bankruptcy followed in December 1985. A sought-for merger partner was not found and chapter 7 liquidation of remaining assets resulted in October 1987.
Vector Graphic computers had many innovations, such as the Flashwriter integrated video and keyboard controller. Vector Graphic was known for their Memorite word processing application. When combined with the Flashwriter, the Vector Graphic Memorite software gave low-cost word processing capability, which had previously only been available with dedicated word processors.
As of 2007, Vector Graphic still had a small but active user community.

<doc id="14707387" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14707387" title="Valu-Mart">
Valu-Mart

Valu-Mart was a chain of discount stores founded in Seattle in 1958. Its parent company was Weisfield's Jewelers. For many years Weisfield's was a store that carried jewelry, as well as televisions (many Seattle residents purchased their first television set from them), radios, stereos, and other consumer electronics products. Once Valu-Mart was put into place, Weisfield's strictly became a jewelry store. The chain also had stores in Oregon, where they originally were named Villa-Mart.
Separate grocery sections in the stores featured curbside grocery (or parcel) pickup by placing the grocery bags into numbered bins that rolled onto a conveyor allowing the customer to drive up to the front of the store to pick them up by giving the attendant a plastic card with the numbered bin they used. The groceries were then loaded into the car usually by store employees.
The stores were a direct competitor to another Seattle based membership chain founded by Joe Diamond called Gov-Mart/Baza'r. When Joe Diamond sold Gov-Mart/Baza'r to new owners that relocated the company to Portland, this was the start of Valu-Mart becoming more upscale shedding the discount store image while Gov-Mart/Baza'r continued as a full service discount store with both chains using the curbside pickup of groceries at the from of the grocery sections of their stores. Both companies eliminated the membership policies by the mid-1960s while having a major presence in Washington and Oregon until Fred Meyer aggressively expanded into both markets during the mid-1970s.
The store chain grew to 21 locations with most locations in Washington and Oregon (known in Oregon as Villa-Mart at first) covering every major area from Bellingham to Eugene and Eastern Washington. Locations were also constructed in Anchorage, Reno, and Great Falls Montana. During 1973, some older stores were replaced in the Seattle/Tacoma area when Weisfield's acquired White Front locations after the chain closed most of the Puget Sound locations.
In 1974 (after Gov-Mart/Baza'r would be acquired by PayLess/House of Values) the Valu-Mart name was eliminated and changed to Leslie's to compete with other retailers such as Fred Meyer and neighboring malls by providing a more upscale format that didn't work so well as the result of the mid 1970s inflation concerns while Fred Meyer continued to increase their presence in the Puget Sound region with bigger stores, lower prices, and updates to their current Marketime locations (Fred Meyer locations acquired in the Seattle area during the 1960s without a grocery section) including leasing Valu-Mart locations and other smaller market discount and department stores while K-Mart would expand further in the area with newly built stores (including acquiring the former North Seattle White Front location in 1977) as well as acquisitions of the PayLess (before the chain was considered a drug store) House of Values, and Value Giant (the names used in locations in Pierce, Kitsap, and Thurston counties where the PayLess brand overlapped the original Tacoma drug store brand founded by the Skaggs family) stores during the 1980s. 
Both discount chains (Fred Meyer and K-Mart) would have control of the Seattle/Tacoma market until Target would locate in the late 1980s.
Started as membership stores (similar to Costco), the requirement would disappear by the mid-1960s as the stores would try to switch from a no-frills warehouse look to a full-service and more upscale look, taking efforts to change its status as a junior department store. By the 1970s, space was being leased to other companies with hopes of acquiring the space at a later time focusing on general merchandise needs only. Each store contained clothing, variety, toys, sporting goods, pet (mostly fish), home and garden, electronics, appliances, notions, pharmacy, groceries (in most locations), a sweet shop, automotive (with repair), a restaurant, beauty salon, and a jewelry department (similar to Weisfield's).
The original stores were built in Seattle (in Georgetown off of Corson St.), Tacoma (off 35th St.), Spokane (5204 East Sprague), North Seattle (185th and Aurora), Yakima (905 E Mead), and Bellevue (140th NE and Bell-Red Rd). The Georgetown location served as the flagship store for the chain until 1973 when the chain acquired a former White Front store in Burien and relocated their offices to the new site and shut down the Seattle location.
During the 1960s, stores were built in Kent (Midway), Everett (9028 Evergreen Way), Richland, Anchorage, Spokane (E 525 Francis), as well as five stores in Oregon. According to the September 25th 1965 article in The Seattle Times, the Midway store (located at 252nd and Pacific Hwy So) was the only discount store between Seattle and Tacoma when the 100,000 square foot location opened. It featured a second floor snack bar with a view of the Puget Sound from the dining area. In 1965, the membership requirement was eliminated. Stores were also constructed in Great Falls, Montana and Reno, Nevada. Their distribution center was located in Kent (212th and East Valley Highway) in the newly built Benaroya Business Park.
In the 1960s, the Oregon stores were branded as Villa-Mart (alternatively written as Villa Mart). The first store opened in the early 1960s, in Portland, with another opened soon afterward in Eugene, in 1963. Additional stores followed in Beaverton and Milwaukie in 1966 and 1969, respectively. A Villa-Mart store also was opened in Salem in 1969. The Oregon stores were eventually renamed Valu-Mart.
On September 9, 1970, the Greenwood location (100 NW 85th St.) was opened. It was a very modern store with underground parking for 150 cars with two floors for shopping. This store wasn't built with a grocery store but shared the parking lot with a Lucky store on the property. This store was a 75,000 square foot store that contained an escalator to move customers between the levels of the store. In 1971, fabric sections were added to all 21 locations 
In 1973, Weisfield's sold all five of its Oregon Valu-Mart stores to Portland-based Fred Meyer and pulled out of Oregon. 
The same year, Valu-Mart acquired the former White Front stores in Tacoma, Burien, and Bellevue remodeling the locations to create a mall environment while keeping about a third of the space for themselves. Copying a similar model that Nordstroms did at the time, portions of each of its 21 stores were leased to add such things as Hallmark stores, furniture stores (known as Furniture Mart), liquor stores, laundry mats, arcades, cafeterias, jewelry, beauty salons, and Pirates Plunder Import stores. The aisles in the locations were roomy. The apparel sections contained more upscale clothing with carpeting and mannequins added to the sections. These stores shed many of the traditional discount store appearances, fixtures, and merchandise used at the time. These new stores were close to major shopping malls (Tacoma Mall and Southcenter) and Weisfield's used the new modern, contemporary design to compete with them converting the stores from a "discount" store to a "junior" department store. The corporate offices were relocated to the Burien location (becoming the flagship store) at the back end of the store and the original Georgetown location was shut down while the original Tacoma location was sold to Yard Birds. The arches from the Tacoma and Burien locations were covered with a vinyl siding and renamed Valu-Mart Plaza. The tall White Front street signs were retooled with the Valu-Mart name and could be seen from several miles away.
Improvements were made to the stores by adding one of the first computerized point of sale systems (created by Singer) for a regional retailer in the Northwest. In 1974, the company decided to change the name of the company to Leslie's (named after Weisfield's president Leslie Rosenburg). A new commercial campaign was started featuring Joe Conley (general store owner, Ike Godsey from The Walton's) marketing the store as "Leslie's, America's general store". Sweet shops were eliminated after the Leslie's name change leasing additional space to other businesses such as vacuum cleaner and sewing machine retailers. According to an article published in The Seattle Times on August 10, 1975, Weisfield's 21 department stores accounted for 80 percent of its fiscal revenues ($81.9 million) but decided to pull out of the market because Rosenburg saw the market as "topsy turvy" from the 1970s recessions. Rosenburg saw the additions made to the company within the last five years as overambitious and feared that competing with Fred Meyer would have been a losing battle after noticing new 150,000 square foot locations (the new store design was called "747s") being constructed by the Portland chain in Everett and Tacoma that combined variety, garden, home improvement, and grocery sections under one roof not too far from Leslie's locations. While the sale of the chain made Weisfield's a smaller company at the time, Rosenburg stated "we'll be better off in a business we understand and are comfortable with".
Having sold its five Oregon Valu-Marts in 1973, Weisfield's soon also began selling its non-Oregon locations. The Bellingham, Washington, Leslie's was sold to Pay Less Drug Stores in 1975 as well as a store they owned in Reno Nevada. By 1976, most of the remaining stores were leased by Fred Meyer, and the stores were added to their chain, while the property was still owned by Weisfield's. The Tacoma and Everett locations weren't leased by Fred Meyer since they had recently opened new 150,000 square foot stores a few blocks away from them. The Tacoma location became a Jafco while the Everett location was acquired by Fluke Electronics to become their plant.
With Weisfield's continuing to own the properties that Fred Meyer leased, this kept grocery sections leased to Associated Grocers (where Valu-Mart had a grocery section within the store). Most were converted into Mark-it Foods. A no frills discount store popular in the 1970s that allowed the customers to mark their own prices with a grease pencil as well as bag their own groceries. Stores also contained automotive repair sections which served as Good Year Tire Stores as well. The restaurants and beauty salons continued to keep their leases and operate as independent businesses that operated within the stores even after the Fred Meyer conversion (until Kroger acquired Fred Meyer and purchased the Valu-Mart properties). Some of the restaurants were converted to Eve's (Fred Meyer's dining brand) after the conversion. Some food departments were leased to Fred Meyer later on as remodeling happened in the late 1970s (with the exception of the Burien and Greenwood locations). 
After the Fred Meyer conversion, the Portland-based company became a major retailer with its major expansion of the chain in the Puget Sound area.
The company even sponsored a hydroplane in 1974 built by Ron Jones and piloted by Billy Schumacher (U-74). The hydroplane would later carry the Weisfield's name in 1975.
Valu-Mart continued to own the properties of their locations leasing the space to Fred Meyer until the properties were sold to The Kroger Corporation in the early part of the 21st century since Kroger wanted full control of their interests and needed to tear down or rebuild most of the properties to eliminate separation between the grocery sections and main portions of the store, better lighting and climate control systems, ethernet network systems, better parking, and gas stations. After the sale of the properties, The Midway location was eventually torn down and redeveloped adding a new store, gas station, and additional space to lease in 2007. The Greenwood location (used in Fred Meyer commercials in the late 1970s) has gone through an extensive renovation throughout most of 2012 with additional space added for a grocery section. The Greenwood and Bellevue (after acquiring the White Front site) locations weren't built with a grocery section in the same building. The Greenwood location had a separate building being leased by Lucky Stores when the California-based grocery chain was operating in the Seattle market. The original grocery store (known as Greenwood Market) has been torn down in 2012 for the addition.
Most former Valu-Mart stores are still standing today although most buildings have been extensively remodeled. The Burien store is still operating as a Fred Meyer store. This location was extensively remodeled a few years ago to shed the original White Front design of the store including the trademark concrete arch which Valu-Mart covered up with a modern vinyl siding awning after they acquired the store. The gas station originally built by White Front was torn and replaced with parking. A newer self-service station that fits the current Kroger model, was added on the site. The Everett location served as a plant for Fluke Electronics. Built in the same design as the original Midway store, this building still stands vacant on Evergreen Way a few blocks south from a Fred Meyer that was built in the 1970s. The original Tacoma store is used by Pierce County as their annex offices for county services while the second store they acquired after White Front left the Seattle market is used by Michael's at this time (formerly a Jafco and Best store before that). The Georgetown location operated as Gamel's outlet store during the mid 70s but became vacant for sometime until Treasure House took over the site in the 1980s to make it a flagship store for their crafts business. Micheal's craft store acquired the company and used the site for some time until it was converted into office space. The building is vacant at this time.
The distribution center was used by Ernst for a while until they relocated to the former Pay and Pak distribution center in Kent in the 1990s.
After Fred Meyer acquired the Burien store, the grocery section was still leased to Keith Undenburg and operated as a Stock Market Food Store as a separate department until the early 1990s when the company lost its lease and relocated to the former Pay Less store in Burien (before being acquired by QFC). When remodeled in the 1990s to add groceries to the store, it became one of Fred Meyer's larger stores in terms of square feet (180,000 square feet). Former office space used by Valu-Mart/Leslie's to operate the company was remodeled and used as Fred Meyer's Northwest Regional Offices until the space was relocated to the Midway store after the early 21st century remodel. Fred Meyer's Credit Union was relocated to the second floor of the Midway store (where the former beauty salon operated) until being moved to another shopping center nearby. The Anchorage Valu-Mart was acquired by Fred Meyer as well and became their first store in the state. It is known to be one of the larger retail stores within the chain.

ChoicesUK

ChoicesUK was the second-largest chain of DVD and video game rental shops in the United Kingdom - as well as an AIM listed multi-channel distributor and retailer of DVDs, computer games and CDs.
ChoicesUK, formerly Home Entertainment Corporation (HEC), was established in 1985. In this pre-internet period, the company’s main strategy was to exploit the UK video market.
Initially, the business was centred on video rental through its "Video Box Office" stores (now ChoicesUK Local) which supplied white-label goods to third party convenience stores. The company’s first B2C store opened in 1986, under the name of "Choices Video", offering a selection of videos for rental and various confectionery products. In 1991, the company added a mail-order service for the sale (not rental) of videos and later DVDs.
ChoicesUK’s pre-internet strategy focused upon 3 areas:
- Video and DVD rental through "Choices Video" Stores
- Supplying third-party outlets with white-label videos and DVDs
- Catalogue based mail order service for videos and DVDs
These three areas, saturated the pre-internet marketplace, making ChoicesUK a highly competitive organisation to challenge the market leader Blockbuster Ltd
From 1991 to 2003 ChoicesUK experienced a period of relative continuity, where the established strategy remained largely unchanged, with the exception of minor incremental changes. This was followed by a period of industry flux, in response to the quick emergence of virtual rental companies and Video On Demand (VOD) services such as Sky Box Office.
In response to the threat from the Internet, ChoicesUK decided to re-brand its divisions under this name and focus upon a single brand strategy to encompass all company activities. This aimed to improve brand awareness and increase the overall industry presence in the UK’s home entertainment retail and distribution market.
After this rebranding strategy, ChoicesUK has 3 divisions:
- ChoicesUK stores had 180 outlets located throughout the UK, catering for impulse rentals of DVDs, games and music.
- ChoicesUK Local supplied third-party outlets with white-label DVDs.
- ChoicesUK Direct incorporated the catalogue mail-order service, and transferred this service to an on-line mail order service, through the ChoicesUK website.
ChoicesUK chose to circumvent the DVD-by-mail market, and instead focused upon its physical base of stores and supplying the convenience store sector with new white-label goods.
However, the success of the Internet rental process made ChoicesUK recognise the strategic significance of modern data management systems. This led to various collaborations and partnerships with e-commerce specialists such as QAS plc, Snow Valley Ltd and Charteris plc.
Despite these changes, the company struggled in the changing marketplace. In April 2007, Choices UK issued a profits warning citing "unseasonably fine weather" in the four weeks to 7 April for a big downturn in movie rentals. This had a drastic effect on the value of the company, with shares plunging 50% to 22.5p, valuing the company at £4m - equal to less than two weeks' sales. Two years previous the shares were changing hands at around 200p.
Saddled with £13m of debts and creditors, the company went into administration in August 2007 after the chain failed to secure refinancing for the business. Multi-channel retailer Findel would go on to purchase the wholesale, online and mail order divisions of ChoicesUK on behalf of its sister company Webb Group Ltd, but refused the option to acquire the firm’s High Street retail operation. Administrator PricewaterhouseCoopers continued to look for a buyer of the retail business, whilst closing unprofitable stores.
On 14 September 2007, Blockbuster GB Limited bought the number of remaining retail stores from ChoicesUK Plc. The sale secured employment for approximately 450 employees across 59 stores in the UK. As part of the transaction, Blockbuster GB rebranded the stores as Blockbuster.
On 2 March 2012, The Webb Group who are the parent company of ChoicesUK went into administration as "The Companies did not have the money to pay its liabilities as and when they fell due."

Asos was established on 3 June 2000 by Nick Robertson and Quentin Griffiths. Despite deprecating its original meaning (AsSeenOnScreen), Asos is still written as an uppercase acronym; the exception to the rule being the new logo designed by Ben Lewin in 2008, where it is stylistically shown all in lower case.
In 2001, Asos was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) on the London Stock Exchange.

Asos opened its first international office in Sydney, Australia, in 2012 . Asos extended to the US in September 2013 in Rochester, NY .
During the 2014 Formula One season, Asos.com was a sponsor of the McLaren Formula One team. It was originally assumed that the sponsorship would be a one-off deal lasting only the duration of the 2014 Australian Grand Prix, the inaugural race of the season. However, this has been proven false, as the Asos.com logo was seen on the back of the rear wing of the 2014 McLaren Formula One car, the McLaren MP4-29, throughout the 2014 season.

Here is a summery of my book 
Mr. Travis Smiley and associates, I am a Black author from Indianapolis, Indiana. I have spent the last seven years doing research about the first book of the bible, Genesis. I have composed a substantial amount of evidence to support the fact that Genesis is the true story of an ancient African Ruler in Ethiopia. 
The book of Genesis has been retranslated by the controversial Black author Kevin A. Lee. Kevin uses dictionaries from over one hundred years old and from over seas to destroy what he calls lies and deception. He states that Genesis was indeed the story of an ancient African Ruler who built a historical dam in order to feed a nation in a time of famine. It was a worthless piece of land, equivalent to a dry desert. The dam miraculously turned the dry land into a farm equipped with a high tech irrigation system that later became known as the Garden of Eden. 
Mr. Lee also states this wonderful story never would have been told had not he discovered who wrote the book of Genesis and his purpose. This dam was not only used to feed a nation, it was also used to control the only world in which they lived. You see, this dam sent water down four rivers; one of them was the Nile. The Rulers famous saying was, “Whosoever controls the water rules the world.”
In Mr. Lee’s book, he states that Genesis was written by Joseph, son of Abraham. He makes this claim based on the reoccurring ending of old testament books of the bible; the person who dies at the end of the Hebrew books were usually the author. Joseph died at the end of Genesis. 
The story begins with Joseph running for a political office to become the second head of Egypt. He is soon placed in prison when his opponents reveal his adulterous sins as an adolescent. On the witness stand Joseph diverts the conversation and testifies about his greatest ancestor who was considered a god and how he turned a dry wasted desert into a wonderful paradise called, The Garden of Eden. This story fascinated the King of Egypt because famine plagued the land. Joseph then took seven days to tell this story, knowing the laws stated that any perpetrator who remains free for seven days was a free man. Here Joseph makes plans to not only escape the charges against him; he secretly orchestrated a plan to become elected the second head of Egypt. Mr. Lee states in his book that it did not take seven days to create the world, it took seven days for Joseph to tell the story you are about to hear. 
On the first day of creation, the bible said God created heaven, earth and light. Mr. Lee says that earth could not have been created because the word earth back then was defined as topsoil, otherwise dust, dirt or mud. Heaven could not have been created because back then the word heaven was defined as up or something far away. Mr. Lee says that Joseph was narrating the book of Genesis and in this introduction he was giving credit to whom credit is due. Mr. Lee said the ruler started a fire on the mountain to call thousands of workers to build a dam to reserve water for the dry season. The fire was on the side of a mountain could be seen for miles.
On the second day the bible said God separated the water above from the water below with a firmament. In the book Joseph tells the king of Egypt and the senate that the water above was separated from the water below with a firmament, which Mr. Lee believes was in all reality a dam. 
On the third day the bible said God made grass and the trees. Mr. Lee said Joseph was telling the King of Egypt and the senate how the dam made it possible to grow fruit trees and a garden that before now they could never grow due to a lack of a continuous supply of water. 
On the fourth day the bible said God made the two lights. Mr. Lee states that Joseph was explaining time and how they used the stars, sun and moon to tell the seasons. Joseph said the celestial bodies were the time clock in the sky was used to tell them when to plant seeds and when to harvest. Mr. Lee also states that the light on the mountain was used as a warning system for invading armies that may want to invade the land for food and water.
On the fifth day the bible said God created animals. Mr. Lee believes that Joseph told the King of Egypt the predicament of having a garden was all the birds and animals that came from the wilderness to eat the food in their garden. The wild animals also ate the fish in the streams for food. 
On the sixth day the bible said God created humans, both male and female. Mr. Lee states that Joseph was simply telling the King of Egypt that the solution to the problem of the birds and animals eating their garden was scarecrows. So they reached into the ground to pick up sticks, sand and clay to build statues of people to scare away the animals. The statues were scarecrows in the garden. They also built beautiful statues of females to make their garden beautiful.
On the seventh day the bible said God rested. Mr. Lee states Joseph was the one that rested, knowing the laws his plan worked well. Joseph had been out of the dungeon for seven days. Never again would he have to endure the dungeon full of dead bodies, rats and snakes again. On the seventh day Joseph was elected second head of Egypt, the only person Joseph bowed to was the King himself. Dressed in royalty, Joseph was endowed with titles magnifying his deity. If that did not make for a good ending, Joseph also got the girl.
For thousands of years this story was told around the world in all language, by word of mouth. When it was made possible to record this story, the myths of Egypt and other countries destroyed the truth, definition of words changed, and the story was lost forever. Now after seven thousand years, the memories of a dead Ruler has resurrected. What you are about to read is the true account of what occurred in a garden called Eden.
Now without further ado I give this book to the world free of charge. Log on to www.damcreation.com and read the most powerful story on earth from beginning to end.

I cannot do the step "3. Clear the "for the originating web site only" checkbox" because I do not have a checkbox like that presented to me... I'm sure if I had such a checkbox this wouldn't be a big problem... maybe it isn't a big problem at all and I'm just making it as such.
Nevermind, I'm mentally retarded... it works for some unknown reason now @_@
How do I make an image template box?
There appear to be some invalid XML entities such as that occur on older pages which make XML parsing of Wikipedia difficult.

Acme Attractions

Acme Attractions was a London clothing store on Kings Road, Chelsea, London that in the early 1970s provided a place for many punk and reggae musicians and scensters to hang out. The "Don" of Acme was shop assistant and manager Don Letts:
Acme Attractions was inspired by Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's Fifties-inspired boutique "Let it Rock" (revamped in 1972 and renamed Too Fast To Live Too Young To Die). In spring 1974, a radical change saw the shop become SEX: selling fetish wear and Westwood's innovative designs.
Acme's owner, John Krivine, decided to venture into clothing with a man called Steph Raynor. In 1974, Acme Attractions initially opened as a stall on the Kings Road, Chelsea in a place called the Antiquarius. While the store was owned by Krivine and Raynor its public face was Don Letts who says that Acme was selling, "electric-blue zoot suits and jukeboxes, and pumping dub reggae all day long.". The store would actually have to move to the basement, after complaints about Don Lett's pounding dub reggae.
Within two weeks of opening there were queues around the block to get in. Steph Raynor remembers:
By the mid 70s, Acme had quite a scene attracting the likes of The Clash, the Sex Pistols, Chrissie Hynde, Patti Smith, Deborah Harry and Bob Marley. Letts remembers that "Marley ... come by because he knew he could get a good draw from the thriving black-market action that also went on in Acme." The scene created by the shop also led to the formation of Generation X, which launched the pop music career of Billy Idol.<br>The Acme accountant, Andrew Czezowski, seeing the potential in the crowd the store attracted started up The Roxy, the first punk-rock venue in London, so that people could go from the store and have some place to party. Letts was the first house DJ.
Seeing the success of punk and how a new market was created for punk related clothing and merchandise John Krevine and Steph Raynor closed Acme Attractions to create Boy. While Don Letts opened the new store, he soon quit, "It was the bastard child of Acme, created to capitalize on the "tabloid punk" and although I opened and ran the joint it just weren't my speed. I quit to manage the Slits and headed off on the White Riot tour with The Clash."

SA Waste Holdings (Pty) Ltd is a waste management company, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, in Gauteng Province. It was launched in 1990, and boasted 626 staff members. The company boasts clients in the retail, commercial, entertainment and gambling sectors. SA Waste is a BEE (Black Economic Empowerment) conscious company, and has a Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) subsidiary, Kofifi Thusano (Pty) Ltd.
SA Waste Holdings (Pty) Ltd is a registered recycler with the Gauteng Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment (DACE) as of 30 September 2005, and a registered transporter with the same department, as of 19 September 2007.
The company and its subsidiaries are listed in a variety of online business directories and government sources such as FindSA, Firstier, and "Business Day"'s list of companies. On 18 March 2005, they appeared in a Government Notice, on the Schedule of designated employers that have submitted employment equity reports in terms of Section 21, of the Employment Equity Act, Act No. 55 of 1998.
SA Waste is a registered contractor with Sabai (a townhouse complex in Randburg). It is unclear what services they provide to Sabai, as Pikitup is the only company in Johannesburg that is permitted to collect waste form residential buildings.
According to the April/May 2000 issue of "Vodaworld" Magazine, Vodacom also counted themselves as a client. SA Waste was responsible for collecting waste from Vodacom's site on a daily basis, and transporting it to their recycling plant, where it would be sorted and sold to external recycling companies.
In 2006 to 2007, the company was a registered supplier to Pikitup, where they were awarded tender number PU 68/2003, providing hire of labour to the parastatal. This contract ended on February 28, 2007.
SA Waste is in the process (as of March 2008) of tendering for another contract at Pikitup. This one will involve providing of a total refuse removal service (Including round-collected refuse removal, street cleaning, servicing of garden sites, and servicing informal settlements) for Johannesburg's Ivory Park area. The closing date for bids on this tender was March 7, 2008, at 11:00 SAST, and proposals are currently being considered. More information on this contract can be found at on the Pikitup website.
On 12 May 2005, Gauteng environment minister Khabisi Mosunkutu paid a surprise visit to their recycling plant in Marlboro, near Alexandra (North of Johannesburg). The company was accused of illegally using their recycling plant to store non-recyclable and unsortable waste. Following the visit, the minister instructed that the site be shut down immediately and be given 14 days to remove all rubbish from the area. This was not the first such warning the company had been issued with. On 29 May 2005, the debacle was reported by the popular wildlife and environmental programme, 50/50. After much effort from SA Waste to clean up their operations, they were granted a conditional green light to resume operations, on 30 September 2005.
On 7 July 2005, SA Waste participated in Reach For a Dream's attempt at the Guinness World Record for a long birthday cake (An event which took place at Cresta Shopping Centre in Johannesburg). This attempt was successful, with the official length of the cake being .

Crown Resorts

Crown Resorts Limited is one of Australia's largest gaming and entertainment groups which had, in June 2015, a market capitalisation of just over A$7.5 billion.
Crown wholly owns and operates two of Australia’s leading gaming and entertainment complexes, Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex in Melbourne and Crown Perth, formerly the Burswood Entertainment Complex, in Perth.
The company was established in 2007 when Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) divested its gaming assets to Crown Limited. PBL was renamed to Consolidated Media Holdings, retaining all of the remaining assets.
In December 2007, Australian gaming company Crown Limited agreed to buy CCR for $1.75 billion. The agreement was ended in March 2009, however, with Crown instead buying a 24.5 percent stake in the company for $370 million, and paying a $50 million termination fee.
In 2008, Crown attempted to enter the Las Vegas gambling market by acquiring a 19.6 per cent stake in Fontainebleau Resorts for US$250 million, which resulted in a total loss the following year when other investors withdrew US$800 million financing, resulting in bankruptcy applications. This was one of a succession of similar major losses in Gateway Casinos, Harrah's Entertainment and Station Casinos from which a total of $547.5 million was written off.
In September 2013, the Sri Lankan government gave approval to Crown's chairman and largest shareholder, James Packer, to invest in Crown Sri Lanka in the heart of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. The project was to be completed by 2015. However, when a new government took office, President Maithripala Sirisena canceled all three casino licenses awarded by the previous administration; including the Crown Resorts project. Ground broke in 2015 and will open in 2017.
In August 2014 Betfair completed the sale of their 50% stake in Betfair Australia to venture partner Crown Resorts, one of Australia's largest gaming and entertainment groups.
In August 2014, Crown bought the site of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip with the intent to build a new hotel beginning in 2015. 
In December 2014, James Packer signed a deal with Matthew Tripp, which gained Packer control over Tripp’s online betting platform BetEasy.
On 26 June 2015, Crown officially announced that the new hotel, called Alon Las Vegas, will be located in the former New Frontier site. Crown announced in December 2016 that it was halting the project and seeking to sell its investment. 
In 2016, ground broke on Crown Sydney and will open in 2020.
In Feb 2017,Barry Felstead replaced Rowen Craigie as CEO Crown Resorts Melbourne.
The company's Crown Resorts Foundation makes grants to the arts, community welfare, education, health care and the environment. In July 2014 Crown's chairman and largest shareholder James Packer launched a new initiative, the National Philanthropic Fund, to which his family foundation, and the Crown foundation would each contribute $100 million over ten years to support community projects in Australia.
In April 2016, the company's joint venture with Matthew Tripp, CrownBet pleaded guilty to five counts of breaching laws by publishing illegal betting advertising that offered inducements for NSW residents to gamble.
According to NSW Department of Justice, CrownBet "sought to have the matters finalised without conviction in Downing Centre Local Court yesterday but Magistrate Joanne Keogh said convictions were necessary for general deterrence to others in the industry and to protect the vulnerable. CrownBet was convicted of the five offences and ordered to pay a total of $10,500 in fines and also ordered to pay L&GNSW legal costs of $10,000."

Joshua Hendy Iron Works

The Joshua Hendy Iron Works was an American engineering company that existed from the 1850s to the late 1940s. It was at one time a world leader in mining technology and its equipment was used to build the Panama Canal, amongst other major projects. The company went on to serve many different markets during the course of its existence, but is perhaps best remembered today for its contribution to the American shipbuilding industry during World War II.
The company was named for its founder Joshua Hendy. Born in Cornwall, England in 1822, Hendy at the age of 13 migrated with two brothers to South Carolina in the United States. Joshua married and became a blacksmith in Houston, Texas After the death of his wife and family from yellow fever, he sailed round Cape Horn to San Francisco in 1849 to participate in the California Gold Rush.
Hendy built California's first redwood lumber mill, the Benicia Sawmill (the region is now known as the Hendy Woods State Park). In 1856, he established the Joshua Hendy Iron Works in San Francisco to supply equipment to Gold Rush placer miners. The Hendy plant supplied various equipment to the mining industry.
By the 1890s, the Joshua Hendy Iron Works was a leader in the mining industry, supplying equipment to mining companies globally, including ore carts, ore crushers, stamp and ball mills and other equipment.
Many of the engineering innovations developed by Hendy became mining industry standards, employed as late as the 1970s, such as the hydraulic giant monitor, the tangential water wheel, the Hendy ore concentrator, the Challenge ore feeder, and the Hendy hydraulic gravel elevator. Hendy giant hydraulic crushers were used to excavate the Panama Canal.
After Joshua Hendy died in 1891, management of the company was taken over by his nephews Samuel and John. In 1906 a fire devastated the original San Francisco factory, and the company was re-established in Sunnyvale, California after the local government enticed the company with free land.
During World War I, the Hendy plant gained its first experience building marine engines by supplying 11 triple expansion steam engines for cargo ships built by Western Pipe & Steel, for the U.S. Shipping Board. Each engine weighed about 137 tons and stood 24½ feet high. Although the first marine engines built by Hendy, they proved to be reliable, with most providing many years of service. Essentially the same engine (with minor improvements) was used for mass production of US Liberty ship engines in World War II.
In the early 1920s, Hendy's hydraulic mining equipment was used in the regrading of Seattle, described as perhaps the largest such alteration of urban terrain in history.
With the onset of the Great Depression however, and hampered by indifferent management, the Hendy Iron Works - like many other heavy equipment manufacturers of the era - fell on hard times. The company adapted by finding new markets, for example by contracting for the building of giant gates and valves for the hydroelectric schemes of the Hoover, Boulder and Grand Coulee dams. During this period it also produced equipment as diverse as crawler tractors, freight car wheel pullers, parts for internal combustion engines and standards for
street lamps. Some of the ornate street lamps built by the company can still be seen in San Francisco's Chinatown district today.
By the late 1930s the company was in financial difficulties and had shrunk to a shadow of its former self, employing only 60 workers. The company was in the process of being taken over by the Bank of California in 1940 when businessman Charles E. Moore, with the financial support of the Six Companies, took a controlling interest. Moore soon managed to contract with the US Navy for the building of some torpedo tube mounts, and shortly thereafter he secured a contract for the building of twelve triple expansion marine steam engines.
By 1942, with the US government's wartime Emergency Shipbuilding Program getting underway, it became clear that a large number of new marine engines would be needed to power the new ships. Since there was a shortfall in capacity to produce modern steam turbines, it was realized that most of the new Liberty ships would have to be fitted with older and slower reciprocating steam engines instead. Admiral Vickery contacted Moore to ask if he could double the original order of 12 engines, to which Moore is reported to have responded that it would be as easy to tool up for a hundred as for a dozen. The company was then contracted to build 118 triple expansion steam engines for the Liberty ships.
As the war progressed and the emergency shipbuilding program continued to expand, so the orders for new engines also grew. Moore responded by streamlining production at the Joshua Hendy plant. He introduced more advanced assembly line techniques, standardizing on more production parts and enabling less skilled workers to accomplish tasks formerly carried out by skilled machinists. By 1943, the company had reduced the time required to manufacture a marine steam engine from 4,500 hours to 1,800 hours. The number of workers employed by the company also grew dramatically, reaching a peak of 11,500 during the war.
By the end of the war, the Joshua Hendy Iron Works had supplied the engines for 754 of America's 2,751 Liberty ships, or about 28% of the total - more than that of any other plant in the country. In addition, the company in the late stages of the war produced 53 steam turbines and reduction gears for the more modern Victory ships. The company also supplied other military equipment during the war, such as turbine generators and antiaircraft gun turrets.
In 1947, the Joshua Hendy Iron Works was sold to the Westinghouse Corporation. In the postwar period, the plant continued to produce military equipment including missile launching and control systems for nuclear-powered submarines, and antiaircraft guns. It also produced pressure hulls for undersea vehicles, nuclear power plant equipment, wind tunnel compressors, large diameter radio telescopes, diesel engines and electrical equipment.
In 1996, Westinghouse sold the plant to Northrop Grumman, which renamed it Northrop Grumman Marine Systems.

Lango (app)

Lango, originally known as Zlango, was an icon-based "language" (actually a logographic writing system) built for web and mobile messaging. Zlango Ltd., the Israeli company which created and owned Zlango, released a Java and Brew application for mobile phones that used the Zlango icon language to create a new form of SMS, called ZMS, using Zlango's icons instead of words.
Zlango was created in 2004 by Yoav Lorch, an author and playwright, as an attempt to shorten text messages. When he found that abbreviated texts only removed 20% of letters, he decided to enter the field of pictographic language. The name Zlango is a combination of lingo, slang, and language, with the letter Z as homage to Esperanto creator L. L. Zamenhof. On February 2007, Zlango Ltd. announced that it raised $12 million from the VCs Benchmark and Accel. Zlango Ltd. was based in Tel Aviv and had around 40 employees at its peak. The company ceased to operate in 2014.
Zlango's products were released in many countries, as well as over the Web, in many forms.
Zlango's mobile application was released in the following territories:
Apart from Zlango's website, Zlango also had an ICQ plug-in in several languages and countries that allows you to use Zlango icons to chat with your contacts.
Zlango also appeared in the Israeli Children's Channel as a game show.
Zlango included more than 300 icons in several different categories. The icons are not definitive, and most icons have multiple meanings: for example, the icon for "me" can also mean "I", the icon for "go" can also mean "come", and the icon for "car" can also mean "drive". The meanings that Zlango intended for each icon were only suggestions as Zlango encouraged users to invent their own personal meanings for icons.
According to Zlango Ltd., the Zlango icons were created to be memorable, rather than recognizable. For example, the "want" icon is a bird in a nest, but once you learn of the icon's meaning, it is difficult to forget.
Zlango released several Zlango versions of classic stories which showed the potential for more than just picture messaging:

<doc id="14748018" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14748018" title="PetMed Express">
PetMed Express

PetMed Express, Inc. also known as 1-800-PetMeds, is an online pharmacy, based in the United States, that sells drugs for pets.
PetMed Express is an online pharmacy that sells drugs for pets.
Its business directly competes with veterinarians, who derive some of their income from selling pet drugs, which has created problems for the company because it can only fill prescriptions written by a veterinarian. This competition, the company's refusal to disclose to veterinarians where it obtains its drugs and how it handles them, and the company's business practices has created distrust in the veterinary community from early on in the company's history.
PetMed Express is licensed or authorized to conduct business in all 50 states in the United States and has received Vet-VIPPS accreditation by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).
Petmed Express was founded in Florida in 1996. Its stock was traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol PETS from September 1997 until March 2000; in March 2000 the company began the process of becoming listed on the National Quotation Bureau Electronic Quotation Service and became responsible for reporting to the SEC. Marc Puleo, an anesthesiologist, was the founding CEO.
Until 2002 PetMed Express and a company called Savemax Inc. operated in the same premises, shared staff, and operated under the same pharmacy licenses; according to the lawyer for both companies, Savemax was formed because of "a concern over PetMed's liability, and whether it [would] continue."
From 1999 to 2002, PetMed Express and SaveMax were charged with violating the pharmaceutical law in several states. In one instance it was fined by the Environmental Protection Agency for selling drugs in metric doses, and has also received a warning letter from the FDA for selling misbranded drugs.
In 1999, PetMed Express settled charges with the Florida Pharmacy Board for selling drugs that did not have prescriptions, false advertising, poor record keeping, and not labelling drugs correctly; PetMed Express paid a fine of around $30,000, agreed to send its pharmacist for further education, agreed to random inspections, and agreed to provide regular reports to the board.
In 2001, Menderes Akdag became the CEO.
In 2002, PetMed Express and Savemax were fined by the EPA for selling drugs marked with metric doses; the drugs were made by Novartis for sale in Europe and Australia and the doses and labelling were not FDA-approved and Novartis sued the two companies for damages.
In 2002, PetMed Express, this time with Savemax, was again charged by the Florida Pharmacy Board for contracting with veterinarians to write prescriptions for animals they had never examined, for selling animals drugs that had not been approved by the FDA, and for sharing its pharmacy license with SaveMax; PetMed Express agreed to dismantle the program, pay penalties, agree to random inspections, and provide free drugs to the community, and to have Savemax move to a different facility and obtain its own license. The Florida board provided information to national boards and encouraged other state boards to take actions against veterinarians who had worked with PetMed Express to provide prescriptions for animals they had not examined. In the same year, the company settled similar charges in Ohio 
In November 2002 the pharmacy board in Texas filed a lawsuit charging PetMed Express with dispensing veterinary drugs without prescriptions. The case was settled in 2006 with a $50,000 fine and three years probation.
The company's 2002 annual report said that its gross profits increased 261 percent in that year and were about $9.5 million and that its sales had increased by 220 percent over the last year.
In 2004 securities class action lawsuits were filed against the company a month after it announced that its earnings were well below the guidance it had provided. The plaintiffs claimed that management had known that its business model competing with veterinarians was not sustainable and that as an unauthorized reseller of drugs, it could not control its supply. In 2005, the lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs.
The company was picked 4th among "Forbes" magazine's "200 Best Small Business Companies" in 2006 and number 6 in 2007. BusinessWeek named PetMed Express number 27 of its top 100 "Hot Growth Companies" in 2006. 
In January 2007, PetMed Express began airing television commercials featuring actress and animal activist Betty White.

Pentosin

Deutsche Pentosin-Werke GmbH, commonly known as Pentosin, is a global independent manufacturer of lubricants and related speciality products. The company was founded in 1927 at Hamburg, Germany. The current Pentosin headquarters are at Wedel, near Hamburg, in the Schleswig-Holstein region or "Bundesländer" of Germany, not far from where the company had been founded.
The company philosophy is: "Quality and Continuity".
In 1927, Heinrich Freudenthal formed a family-owned company, Deutsche Pentosin-Werke, creating veterinary and medical products. The high reputation of the products rapidly developed, and by 1935, the company was licensing the production of various Pentosin products in other countries, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy and Switzerland. The founder also recognised the need to supply the growing automotive markets, and started development of automotive lubricants and hydraulic brake fluids. Around this time, Freudenthal recognised that car makers initiated specific product approvals, and Pentosin progressed their research and development (R&D) in this direction. Pentosin were rewarded with approvals to supply the initial "factory fill", and with the resultant approvals, aftermarket sales progressed in a positive manner. From the outset, Freudenthal demanded a key objective of quality in all Pentosin products, and this stance still remains today.
By the 1960s, Pentosin had a "second wind", and the company enjoyed increased success. As product lines developed and increased, the company was starting to outgrow their current facilities, and so in 1960, started development of a new blending plant at Dormagen, North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1972, the company's original site in Hamburg was now too small, and so moved to a larger premises, a short distance up the river Elbe to their current location of Wedel.
Pentosin produces a wide range of high quality, "original equipment manufacturer" (OEM) specified products, as well as aftermarket products. These include automotive lubricants (engine motor oils, and transmission oils/fluids, for motor cars and motorcycles, including synthetic oils), industrial lubricants, and hydraulic products.
Pentosin products are supplied directly to many different automotive companies, including all marques of the Volkswagen Group, BMW, Daimler AG marques, Ford Motor Company, General Motors Europe and Porsche.
Pentosin FFL-2 is factory fill for the Volkswagen/Audi dual-clutch Direct-Shift Gearbox.

Travel Sentry

Travel Sentry is a company that develops and licenses standards used in travel security, including a standard for luggage locks that can be opened by aviation security agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration.
Travel Sentry was founded in 2003. The first locks manufactured to the "Travel Sentry Approved" standards went on sale on November 12, 2003. Initially, only key and combination padlocks were manufactured using this standard. In 2004, the first luggage with integrated Travel Sentry locks were introduced.
As of 2014 there are over 300 million Travel Sentry locks and luggage in circulation.
Travel Sentry developed a lock system that is "accepted and recognized" by the TSA and other security agencies, and allows them, using special tools and codes, to open and re-lock locks. The tools provided by Travel Sentry are at every luggage screening checkpoint at all 450 airports controlled by the TSA.
The Travel Sentry system is used by security agencies in Austria, Canada, Finland, Germany, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Netherlands, Switzerland and the USA.
The system is licensed by over 500 companies worldwide: primarily luggage brands, lock manufacturers and distributors of travel goods.
In a 2014 article in the "Washington Post" a picture of the special tools was included, and while this picture has was later removed it quickly spread. Security researchers have pointed out that it is now possible for anyone to make new master keys and open the locks without any sign of entry, and the locks can now be considered compromised. It is likely that professional thieves have possessed the master keys well before the publication, perhaps by reverse engineering the TSA-approved locks.

Sexton Foods

John Sexton & Company, also known as Sexton Quality Foods, was a broad line national wholesale grocer that serviced the restaurant, hotel and institutional trade from regional warehouses and truck fleets located in major metropolitan areas of the United States. Sexton Quality Foods eventually became US Foodservice in 1997. The company was established in Chicago, Illinois in 1883 by John Sexton.
John Peter Sexton was born June 29, 1858 in Dundas, Ontario, Canada to Michael and Ellen (Connors) Sexton. (Michael and Ellen had emigrated from County Clare, Ireland and married in Dundas on May 11, 1854 with Cornelius Sexton and Elizabeth Connors witnesses.)
John Sexton worked in a general store in Niagara, Ontario 1874–1877. He immigrated to Chicago in 1877 at 18 and began working for various wholesale grocers in Chicago as a clerk and city salesman. During this time, he realized that there was an opportunity to specialize in selling quality teas, coffees and spices.
John Sexton married Anna Louise Bartleman (born May 22, 1866 Chicago IL ) on August 11, 1886 in Chicago, IL. (Anna Louise's parents, Christian and Theresa (Albrecht) Bartleman had emigrated from Saxe-Coburg Gotha, Germany in the mid-1850s.) The couple had five children: Thomas George (born February 21, 1889 Chicago IL), Franklin (born 2/16/1891), Sherman J. (born 9/12/1892), Helen (Egan) (b.?) and Ethel (Marten) (born 1896). The family home was at 2238 North Dayton Street in Chicago. All three sons and both sons-in-law worked for the company in various roles.
In 1883, at the age of 25, John Sexton invested his entire life savings of $400 and formed a corporation with George A. Hitchcock, the Hitchcock & Sexton Company, which opened a small office at 5 Wabash in downtown Chicago. Within a year, Hitchcock & Sexton moved to 20 State Street (at State and Lake) which was owned by John DeKoven.
As business increased, Hitchcock & Sexton opened three more retail stores in the Chicago area, including one in Joliet. This made Hitchcock & Sexton one of the first retail coffee and tea chain proprietors in the United States. In 1886, Hitchcock sold Sexton his interest in the business and renamed the company John Sexton & Co. To help run the business, John Sexton recruited his sisters Mary (Barton); Sarah (O'Leary); Brigid "Bea" (Mulligan), who later married widower Francis Upton; and his younger brother James J. Sexton to move to Chicago from Dundas, Ontario. The sisters each ran one of his retail stores and lived above it with their families. In addition to family, John Sexton relied on recruiting high-quality employees by offering attractive wages, sales commissions and fair dealing.
As word spread of Sexton’s quality products, fair dealings and unconditional guarantee, restaurant and hotel customers came to the Sexton retail stores to buy spices, tea and coffee. Sexton also added dried and canned goods to his stores. In addition, he began to call on the Chicago restaurants and hotels directly. He hired salesmen and delivery drivers to service on the wholesale accounts, and purchased horses and wagons to make deliveries. By 1888, Sexton decided to close his four retail stores and focus solely on his Chicago wholesale customers. He expanded the State Street store by renting the rest of the building. 
In 1890, Sexton established an institutional department to call on hospitals, colleges, schools, railroad dining cars and orphanages around the country. These customers required consistent quality products that were available in sufficient quantity all year long. Sexton developed an extensive product line as well as a distribution network based in Chicago. To call on the institutional market throughout the country, he recruited commission-based salesmen in the major urban markets of Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New York, Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Washington DC.
In addition to the major urban markets, Sexton recruited regional commission-based salesmen to call on customers who required quality groceries in large quantity to feed their clients or work force, but were far from major metropolitan areas. Regional salesmen called on lumbermen, ranchers, miners and grain farmers who had large work forces to feed. These salesmen would also call on hotels, restaurants, hotels, hospitals, schools and orphanages. To further establish the Sexton brand, he advertised in specific hospital and institutional dietician publications. The most effective marketing was at professional trade conventions where Sexton Quality Foods would sponsor a tasting booth featuring its products. Institutional customers could sample products and Sexton salesmen could develop contacts and sales leads. This proved enormously successful since no other grocery company at the time was effectively servicing this huge market. The 1893 Chicago’s World Fair provided a chance to showcase Sexton’s ability to deliver quality food in large quantity to meet the demand of the huge influx of tourist into Chicago.
In 1898, John Sexton & Co. was incorporated. The company directors were John Sexton, President; Dan E. Upton (cousin), Vice President, Harold R. White, Secretary; and William M. O'Leary (nephew), Treasurer.
As John Sexton & Co. grew, the Sexton name became synonymous with quality products, fair dealings, uniform consistent food quality and unconditional guarantee. A bronze plaque hung in the building lobby read "All who come here to buy or sell fairly are always welcome."
Some of the original brand names used by Sexton included Calumet, LaSalle, Pride of the West, Pyramid and Edelweiss. The most lasting innovation pioneered by John Sexton & Co. was the 1 gallon #10 can. Hailed as the perfect restaurant pack size, the #10 can was sanitary, economical and revolutionized kitchen storage since it was easy to lift, easy to open, stacked well and did not require refrigeration. The #10 can is still the industry standard.
At the end of 1907, John Sexton & Co. had 125 employees in Chicago, a large Chicago customer base serviced by a city sales force, a national customer base serviced by a regional sales force, and a strong rural mail order trade. Sexton had outgrown the State Street location, so moved the company four blocks west to the corner of Lake and Franklin Streets (236 W. Lake Street). In 1908, Sexton Quality Foods leased the entire six-story building for a term of 10 years that expired April 1918. Prior to moving in, electric service and elevators were installed. A side note in Chicago real estate history, in 1885, J.B. Clow & Sons, a cast iron pipe manufacturer entered into a 99-year ground lease with landowner John Peacock at a rate of $3,000 per year with 4% annual increases. That same year, J.B. Clow & Sons constructed a six-story office building. In 1908, J.B. Clow & Sons relocated to a larger building at Harrison and the River and leased the building to John Sexton & Co. By 1909, John Peacock's widow sold the ground to George L. Thatcher for $173,000. John Sexton & Co. organized the building into sales, warehouse, manufacturing and laboratory. At the new location, Sexton expanded into the manufacture of pickles, relishes, spices and preserves. Company horses were stabled at a livery one mile west of the building.
By 1912, Sexton had outgrown the Lake and Franklin location. In 1913, Sexton purchased a parcel of land on the north side of the Chicago River on the corner of Illinois and Orleans Streets. The majority of Sexton’s customers at that time were not in Chicago. Access to the railroads was critical to growing the business. Institutional customers throughout the country would order groceries by the railcar from Sexton Quality Foods, and Sexton wanted his new building to be able to receive and dispatch rail shipments directly. In 1913, construction of a , six-story, fire sprinkler-protected, multi-use building designed by architect Alfred S. Alschuler was started. 
In 1915, Sexton moved into the new building that housed the corporate offices, sales offices, country division, dry goods warehouse, food laboratory, refrigeration plant, and the Sexton Quality Foods manufacturing division, the Sunshine Kitchens, which produced private label sauces, soups and specialty products exclusively sold under the John Sexton & Co. banner. The first floor was divided into railcar receiving, railcar shipping, country parcel shipping, city delivery and city receiving. The building was large enough to unload three railcars simultaneously.
By 1921, Sexton had established distribution warehouses in San Francisco, Dallas and Omaha. This was done partly to improve customer service by reducing the time between order and delivery. In addition, a majority of canned fruits, jellies and preserves were grown and packed on the west coast. Considerable freight expense could be saved by dividing the products according to regional demand. These warehouses would later become important branches for Sexton Quality Foods.
In 1924, John Sexton decided to modernize the company's city delivery fleet by purchasing 26 electric trucks from The Commercial Truck Company of America in Philadelphia, and purchasing six gasoline-powered, 1.5 ton, six-wheeled trucks manufactured by Diamond T of Chicago. The modernization retired 50 horses, 35 grocery wagons and saved $12,000 in the first year. Each CT electric truck averaged per delivery day, and were extremely reliable, easy to drive and well adapted for city deliveries. However, in cold weather, their batteries were less efficient and the hard rubber tires had poor traction on snow-covered streets. The result was a diminished range for the electric trucks. The electric trucks were in service until the late 1930s and were gradually phased out as the Chicago area expanded into the suburbs, the delivery route mileage increased, the roads got better and commercial truck reliability improved. The six Diamond T Trucks were used for suburban Chicago deliveries and averaged each per delivery day in 1924.
In 1897, Sexton Quality Foods began publishing a mail order catalog, targeted to rural customers, and selling food and farm supplies. Orders were shipped from Chicago via rail to regional terminals where railway express would make the final delivery to the customer. Sexton Quality Foods' catalog business was an important division for years. It was ultimately led by Sexton’s second oldest son, Franklin, who later led the coffee and tea division and became the company treasurer. Known as the “Country Division”, the majority of the products sold were coffee, spices, flour, canned fruits and canned vegetables. However, paint, motor oil, nails, roof tar and canvas were also sold. The Sexton Country Division flourished until automobiles became affordable and rural automobile ownership increased. Rural customers were then more likely to drive to town to make frequent smaller purchases rather than place large orders from Chicago. The last country division catalog was published in the late 1930s.
In 1928, at age 70, John Sexton stepped down as president of Sexton Quality Foods but remained its chairman. He asked his sons, Thomas, Franklin, and Sherman, who should lead the company. All agreed that Sherman was the best choice, and he became president of the company in 1928. Franklin remained the treasurer and Thomas remained vice president of merchandising. In 1930, at age 71, John Sexton died while on vacation in Los Angeles. After his death, the ownership of the company was divided between John Sexton’s wife Annie Louise (33%) and their children Thomas (13.3%), Franklin (13.3%), Sherman (13.3%), Helen (13.3%) and Ethel (13.3%).
By late 1931, the John Sexton & Co. leadership was as follows: Annie Louise (Bartleman) Sexton, Chairman; Sherman J. Sexton, President (Sales and Advertising); Harold R. White, Vice President (Canned and Dried Foods); Franklin Sexton, Secretary (Tea and Coffee); and Edmund A. Egan, Treasurer (Maintenance and Operation). In 1933, Sexton Foods opened its first distribution center outside Chicago by renting a warehouse in Brooklyn and buying a delivery fleet of five Diamond T trucks dedicated to the New York market. The New York sales office was then supported by a regional distribution network that could provide next-day delivery. The same year, the first Sexton professional salesman training school was established, led by Henry A. Marten, husband of Ethel.
Sexton Quality Foods expanded its print advertising to the restaurant, college, hospital and food service trade publications in order to directly reach their customers. In addition, Sexton Quality Foods had a sales booth at all major trade conference for hospital administrators, college dietitians and restaurant associations. Sexton also published the first Sexton Cookbook in 1937, with two subsequent cookbooks published in 1941 and 1950. These compiled large-quantity recipes that Sexton customers had developed. Sexton Quality Foods frequently published pamphlets with menu ideas, food suggestions and business hints. Sexton Quality also published annual hardcover diaries that featured customers' recipes.
In January 1941, the company expanded by opening a branch warehouse and truck fleet in Dallas, at 411 Elm Street, the later Texas School Book Depository. In November 1961, Sexton left the building for a modern single-story facility in the Brook Hollow Industrial District located at 650 Regal Row, Dallas, Texas. The Dallas branch would receive railcars of groceries from suppliers, canners and the Sexton Quality Foods Manufacturing Divisions.
In 1941, Sexton introduced a line of frozen fruits and vegetables. The frozen food line was discontinued in mid-1942 due to the United States entering World War II and the need for Sexton to focus on providing groceries to the war effort. In August 1943, John Sexton & C.o purchased the J.C. Stewart Company, an institutional wholesaler, coffee roaster and spice blender located in Pittsburgh. Stewart Company had annual sales of $2 million, had extensive coffee roasting facilities, and was a leading processor of maraschino cherries and spices. Sexton relocated all coffee and spice blending operations to Pittsburgh. The investment banking firm of Floyd D. Cerf Company of Chicago represented Sexton in the transaction. By 1943, Sexton had the ability to supply, manufacture and distribute large amounts of institutional groceries from its warehouses in Chicago, Brooklyn, Dallas and Pittsburgh.
In 1946, Sexton purchased a six-story building from stationery supplier Deeps, Inc. The building was located at 32-04 Northern Boulevard, Long Island City, NY and had been originally constructed for the Standard Radiator Co. As World War II ended, the third generation returned from war service and began working for the company. During this time, there were three sons, two son-laws, many cousins and over 25 grandsons working for Sexton Quality Foods.
By 1949, John Sexton & Co. was operating branch warehouses in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Long Island City, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Territories served by a Sexton salesman, but too remote from a Sexton branch warehouse, received rail shipments directly from Chicago. The majority of Sexton manufacturing was still done at the Chicago facility. However, the chemical manufacturing plant had moved to Philadelphia. The coffee roasting and spice blending operations had moved to Pittsburgh. In 1950, Sexton Quality Foods leased a warehouse in San Francisco to support the established west coast sales force and to expand into California, Oregon and Washington.
On December 29, 1951, John Sexton’s widow, Annie Louise Sexton, 90 years of age, chairman of John Sexton & Company, died in Miami Beach. At the time of her death, she had 5 children, 25 grandchildren and 62 great-grandchildren. She is buried next to her husband at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.
In January 1953, Sexton purchased the Columbia Conserve Company, a food manufacturer located in Indianapolis. The Sunshine Kitchens relocated to the newly purchased facility. However, Indianapolis grocery orders were still shipped from Chicago. This was because each night, up to six Sexton trucks from the Indianapolis facility would deliver Sexton-manufactured products to the Chicago warehouse and return with the next day's Indianapolis orders.
In October 1953, five grandsons were elected to the board of directors: John S. Marten of Indianapolis, Alfred Egan of Dallas, John P. Sexton of Philadelphia, Thomas W. Sexton of Chicago and William C. Sexton of Chicago. Franklin Sexton, Thomas G. Sexton, Edmund Egan remained as board members. At the close of 1953, Harold R. White, Vice President (Canned and Dried Foods) retired after 50 years with the company. Harold was the leading authority on canned and dried foods in the wholesale grocery industry and oversaw Sexton's food quality standards and laboratory. Ora Chidester was elected Vice President (Canned and Dried Foods). Matthew Theis, Vice President (Manufacturing) retired after 50 years with the company. Harry P. Gaugham was elected Vice President (Manufacturing). Franklin Sexton retired as secretary of the company after 47 years of service, but remained a board member. Stanley Wojteczko, company controller was elected secretary of company.
In early 1955, Sexton announced plans to sell the Illinois and Orleans building and construct a new warehouse on at 47th Street and Kilbourne Avenue on the south side. The new warehouse would house the distribution and sales office for Chicago. All food manufacturing was relocated to Indianapolis and the existing Indianapolis plant was enlarged. The John Sexton & Co. building on the corner of Illinois and Orleans was converted to condominiums in the mid-1990s. The terra cotta "JS & Co" logos in the brickwork are still visible.
During the 1950s, Sexton Quality Foods experienced rapid growth as the nation began to dine out more and food service customers demanded quality and consistent products and timely deliveries. By 1958, the company's 75th anniversary, Sexton had a coast-to-coast distribution network with warehouses, sales operations and truck fleets located in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Francisco to service over 50,000 customers.
On March 13, 1956, 63-year-old Sherman Sexton died unexpectedly of an aneurysm. He is buried at All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines. Sherman had begun work for his father at the Lake and Franklin location as a Teamster in 1909 and his career had spanned 47 years. Sherman had led the company from a Chicago-based grocery mail order house to a coast-to-coast foodservice distributor with over $40 million in sales. His untimely death created enormous turmoil since there was no clear succession for company leadership. 65-year-old Thomas G. Sexton stepped in as president. Brothers Thomas, Franklin and Sherman had all joined the Teamsters Union on the same day in 1909. Tom had been vice president in charge of merchandising since 1926. In late 1956, Beatrice Foods approached Thomas G. Sexton and Ethel Marten (daughter of John Sexton) with an offer to purchase John Sexton & Co.; both declined.
In March 1959, the board of directors held a special election for a new company president. The four candidates were Thomas G. Sexton, Thomas Webb Sexton (son of Thomas G.), John S. Marten (son of Ethel) and Thomas Mackin ("Mack") Sexton (son of Franklin). Mack Sexton won the vote and became president in 1959. Thomas G. Sexton became chairman of the board. 
On November 16, 1960, John Sexton & Co issued 200,000 shares (26.76%) of the 747,437 shares outstanding at $16.50 per share in the over the counter market (NASDAQ) to become a public company. 33,000 of the shares represented new financing of the company for use as working capital. The 200,000 share offer were oversubscribed and closed at $16.50 per share. Hornblower & Weeks was the managing underwriter. The financial structure of the company had evolved from its humble beginnings as a partnership formed in Chicago in 1883 to a public company with 747,437 shares outstanding with 72% held by family members and 26.76% held by the public.
The desire for John Sexton & Co. to go public was to gain better access to the commercial credit market. Sexton's management saw the opportunity to expand product lines and distribution networks, but its capital structure as a private company limited its borrowing capacity. As a public company, Sexton capital stock could be issued to purchase other grocery companies and fund expansion. In addition, the Sexton family held the majority of their wealth in the private John Sexton & Co. stock. Some family members wanted a publicly traded stock which could easily be sold at a true market price. The alternative was to try to sell their Sexton shares to another family member at a negotiated price.
In 1961 John Sexton & Co. had over 1,400 employees, including 300 salesmen who were generating $49.5 million. 10 Sexton distribution warehouses were located in Atlanta; Chicago; Dallas; Detroit; Englewood, New Jersey; Indianapolis; Newton, Massachusetts; Pittsburgh; Philadelphia; and San Francisco, California.
Sexton serviced over 50,000 customers located throughout the USA, of which 40% were restaurants, 28% were schools and colleges, and 32% consisted of clubs, hospitals, convents and hotels.
The Sexton catalogue included over 2,250 food and non-food items, of which 26% were manufactured in Sexton manufacturing facilities located in Indianapolis and Englewood. The rest of the Sexton products were manufactured by non-affiliated third parties.
The Sexton delivery fleet consisted of 112 trucks and tractor-trailer combinations, of which 95 were owned by the company and the remainder leased. In certain areas of the country, Sexton utilized common carriers to deliver their products.
Sexton was focused on meeting the rising demand from their customers as America began to embrace away-from-home eating as entertainment. To meet the increased demand, Sexton began modernizing its warehouses and manufacturing facilities.
As of June 30, 1961 John Sexton & Co. was generating $49.5 million in sales and the balance sheet had current assets of $15.4 million with liabilities of $4.9 million including $3.9 million of long term debt, $1.0 million of accounts payable and working capital of $10.5 million consisting of short term revolving credit lines. Book value was $16.57 per share. Dividends had consistently been paid since 1935 and in 1961 were paying $0.90 per share.
In July 1961, Franklin Sexton, secretary of the company, son of John Sexton, died at age 70. He had begun his career on State Street store in 1909 working for his father, John Sexton, as a Teamster making grocery deliveries in Chicago by horse and wagon. He oversaw the expansion of the country division, expansion of Sexton's national distribution network, the building of the Sexton plant on Illinois & Orleans and led the Sexton coffee and tea product lines. His career spanned over 50 years. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, IL.
On October 4, 1961, John Sexton & Co. conducted a secondary offering of 70,000 share of stock at $23.50 per share at the request of the Ethel Sexton Marten Family and the Franklin Sexton Estate. The Marten family sold 49,924 of 50,924 shares and the Franklin Sexton Estate sold 20,076 of 57,436 shares. Hornblower & Weeks was the managing underwriter. The Marten family, led by sons John S. Marten and Harry Marten, left the company and purchased Fred's Frozen Foods, a food manufacturer located in Noblesville, Indiana.
In 1961, Sexton announced a major capital plan to add product lines, expand into new territories and modernize its distribution system. New warehouses were built or leased in Dallas, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Francisco and Philadelphia. Plans to roll out a computer-based inventory and accounting system were established. In 1962, John Sexton & Co. and S.E. Rykoff & Co. of Los Angeles entered negotiation where Sexton Quality Foods would purchase Rykoff in a stock and debt assumption transaction. Rykoff had a very strong presence in the Los Angeles foodservice market that was attractive to Sexton Foods. Sexton Foods preferred to purchase a strong local market leader, rather than starting from scratch, since a new market could be penetrated much faster. Sexton Foods and S.E. Rykoff were not able to reach agreement. After which, Sexton Quality Foods announced plans to open a warehouse and Sexton truck fleet in the Compton warehouse district of Los Angeles to support the southern California and Nevada Sexton sales force. Also in 1962, the Long Island City Sexton warehouse building was sold and Sexton relocated to a modern distribution and manufacturing facility located at 360 Van Brunt St, Englewood, NJ
In 1964, Sexton purchased the institutional wholesale grocery department of National Brands Inc. located in Miami, FL. A Sexton Warehouse was established in Miami that year. In 1965, Sexton purchased Cincinnati Foods, Inc., an institutional wholesaler located in Cincinnati, OH and a Sexton Warehouse was opened.
In 1965, Sexton began a capital investment in data processing to transition away from the traditional ledger inventory control and accounting. Using the IBM System/360 mainframe, Sexton designed a software system to automate inventory records, customer billing and accounts receivable. To insure a smooth transition, the automated accounting system was rolled out branch by branch during 1965. The data processing center was located in the general offices in Chicago.
In 1967, John Sexton & Co. operated 12 branch warehouses, which served over 79,000 customers throughout the continental United States, in the West Indies and Hawaii. Sexton branch warehouses were located in Atlanta, Boston (Newton, MA), Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York (Englewood, NJ), Orlando, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Francisco. These branches and the 370 sales territories covered 500 of the major US metropolitan areas where 90% of all restaurants, schools, hospitals and foodservice customers were located. Approximately, 70% of all foodservice purchases were made through route salesmen or telephone orders. By 1967, 31% of foodservice customers purchased 76% of the food volume due to regional and national chains. The balance of the foodservice purchases was from small independent restaurants, schools, hospitals and foodservice providers. Sexton’s quality products, national distribution network and sales force allowed it to provide the service that the varied customers demanded.
In 1967, nearly all 2,250 products distributed by Sexton were sold under its own trade names, brands and labels. Products included a broad line of canned foods, canned and processed meats, coffee, tea spice and paper products, everything except frozen foods, meat, milk and fresh produce. About 27 percent of the products distributed by Sexton were manufactured, processed, packed, bottled, or canned in Sexton manufacturing plants, the balance of the Sexton products were purchased from other food manufacturers. To insure high quality foods, Sexton had operated food laboratories since the 1890s for the systematic testing of "quality" in the products it produced, the products it distributed and for the development of new products. By July 1, 1967, Sexton had developed and placed on the market a number of new convenience products including "Jet Set," an instant gelatin, canned "Chopped Chicken Livers" and "Spoon-Redi," a line of puddings to be spooned directly from the can into dessert dishes. Although frozen and refrigerated food products were explored by Sexton, the majority of the foodservice customers in 1967 had yet to invest in cold storage in their kitchens.
In 1968, Mack Sexton was approached by Beatrice Foods with an offer to purchase the John Sexton & Co. Beatrice Foods was attracted to Sexton Quality Foods’ distribution network, quality, variety of private label products, specialized food offerings, sales force and profitability. Mack Sexton’s initial response was no, but Beatrice Foods was very interested. Eventually both parties reached an agreement. Beatrice Foods increased the purchase, pledged capital to expand Sexton Quality Foods distribution network, pledged capital to introduce a new Sexton frozen product line and pledged that the Sexton leadership would continue to lead and operate the company as a separate entity. On December 20, 1968, Beatrice Foods acquired the business and assets of John Sexton & Co., exchanging approximately 375,000 shares of Beatrice's preferred convertible preference stock valued at $37,500,000. John Sexton & Co. would become a separate independent division of Beatrice Foods still led by Mack Sexton (son of Franklin), William Egan (son of Helen) and William Sexton (son of Sherman). Mack became a vice president of Beatrice and a Beatrice board member. John Sexton & Co. put Beatrice Foods into the wholesale grocery business and Beatrice put John Sexton & Co. into the frozen foods business. Beatrice Foods and the Sexton leadership were interested in maximizing the investment in John Sexton & Co. by growing the company.
In 1969, rather than proceeding with the original Sexton Quality Foods plan to acquire a frozen food manufacturer, Sexton tapped Beatrice Foods frozen foods expertise and capital to launch a Sexton frozen product line that included frozen meats, fruits, vegetables and ethnic entrees. Sexton Quality Foods new frozen line required the addition of industrial freezer storage to all 12-branch warehouses and retrofitting all delivery trucks with freezers. Over the next 4 years, six of the eight planned additional Sexton branch warehouses were opened in Hawaii, Indianapolis, Houston, Saint Louis, Seattle and Minneapolis.
In January 1978, Thomas G. Sexton, son of the founder, retired president and chairman of the company died at the age of 88 at his home in Buffalo Grove, IL. Tom Sexton began work for his father in 1909 at the Lake & Franklin location. His first job was as a teamster delivering grocery in Chicago by horse and wagon. His career spanned 51 years until his retirement in 1959.
Beatrice Foods operated John Sexton & Co. as an independent division until 1983. Mack Sexton remained president of John Sexton & Co., a vice president of Beatrice and had a seat on the Beatrice board of directors until his retirement in 1981. A legal side note, Mack Sexton was the defendant in the first successful age discrimination case. Beatrice allegedly pressured Mack to improve business results. Mack decided to remove family members from the company. On January 24, 1977, Mack Sexton, president of the Sexton Division, called his cousin William C. Sexton (son of Sherman J. ) into his office and discharged him, indicating that more aggressive "younger blood" was required for management. William Sexton was 59 years old and a 41-year employee. Please see Sexton v. Beatrice Foods for more information. By the early 1980s Beatrice Foods was a $12 billion far-reaching multinational corporation with diverse holdings including Avis Rent A Car, Shedd's, Tropicana, Good & Plenty, Swift's Premium (including Butterball Turkey), Culligan, Rusty Jones, Samsonite Luggage and Playtex. Beatrice Foods had increasingly focused on divisions that yielded the larger profit margins than food, which typically yields consistent 2% to 3% profit margins. As a result, Beatrice Foods withheld capital investment into its food divisions.
After many years of buying companies, Beatrice Foods began the process of divesting. In 1983, Beatrice Foods announce that it was divesting 50 business of which, John Sexton & Co. was generating $380 million in sales which represented a 10% annual revenue growth since its purchase in 1967.
The CEO of S.E. Rykoff & Co., Roger Coleman approached Beatrice with an offer to buy John Sexton & Co. Beatrice initially said no. In 1983, S.E. Rykoff & Co. ($346 million in sales) was a broad line grocer and restaurant equipment provider that operated in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. Rykoff had begun in 1911 as a family grocery store located near Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. In 1919, Saul Rykoff dropped his retail customers and focused exclusively on wholesale customers. In 1972 S.E. Rykoff & Co. went public and the shares were traded in the over the counter market (NASDAQ).
S.E. Rykoff & Co. CEO, Roger Coleman persuaded Beatrice Foods to sell John Sexton & Co. for $84 million. With the purchase of Sexton Quality Foods, Rykoff double in size, gained a national distribution network of 18 warehouses, a national sales force, recognized brand name, a loyal customer base, food manufacturing facilities, food laboratories, test kitchens, chemical manufacturing facilities, a coffee roasting plant and a spice blending operation. The Sexton Quality Foods west coast branches in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Hawaii were absorbed into the Rykoff operations. Sexton Quality Foods branches in the south, Midwest, east and south continued to operate under the Sexton banner. In 1984, to reflect the importance of the Sexton Foods acquisition, S.E. Rykoff & Co. changed the company name to Rykoff-Sexton. However, Rykoff-Sexton continued to operate Sexton Quality Foods and Rykoff as two separate companies since merging the two companies was a complex task that involved customers, labor, systems, brands, products and corporate identity.
By the early 1990s, Rykoff-Sexton had successfully merged the two separate operating companies and was labeling the majority of the products under the Rykoff-Sexton banner. The result was better operating efficiencies, economies of scale and recognizable brand name. In 1995, Rykoff-Sexton relocated the headquarters from Los Angeles to Lisle, Illinois. Rykoff-Sexton was generating $1.6 billion in annual sales, which represented a 7% annual revenue growth rate since 1984.
By the mid-1990s, the restaurant industry had further evolved into a chain system which demanded consistent, ready-to-assemble food products. Large national restaurant chains wanted to deal with one large national food distributor that could reliably provide products to their exact specifications. Rykoff-Sexton's management had decided that the best strategy was to strategically purchase other broad line grocers and grow revenue. During the mid-1990s, Rykoff-Sexton purchased Continental Foods of Baltimore for an undisclosed price and H&O Foods of Las Vegas for $5.5 million in cash and assumption of $26.6 million in debt.
In February 1996, Rykoff-Sexton and US Foodservice of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania announced their intent to merge. The merger was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. In 1996, US Foodservice was generating $1.5 billion in revenue and Rykoff-Sexton was generating $2 billion. The merger would combine the third and fourth largest U.S. broadline foodservice distributors with combined annual sales of approximately $3.5 billion. The 8.8 million shares of US Foodservice were exchanged for $270 million in Rykoff-Sexton stock. The $350 million in US Foodservice debt was assumed by Rykoff-Sexton. Rykoff-Sexton (RYK) funded the purchase by issuing 14.3 million new shares at $25 per share. In September 1996, the newly merged Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice announced that corporate headquarters would be relocated to Wilkes-Barre.
In 1997, Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice was generating $3.2 billion in annual sales. The combined company was in the process of re-branding all products to the US Foodservice brand by dropping the Rykoff-Sexton, S.E. Rykoff & Co. and John Sexton & Co. brands. It was determined that a standardized and easily recognizable brand would better compete in the rapidly consolidating foodservice market. In addition, the US Foodservice brand would reflect a nationwide presence and distribution capabilities. During this time, the company headquarters were moved to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
In July 1997, JP Foodservice and Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice reached an agreement to merge the two companies. Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice shareholders would exchange their Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice stock for JP Foodservice stock. All outstanding Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice shares were exchanged for $680 million in JP Foodservice stock. The $700 million in Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice debt was assumed by the merged Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice-JP Foodservice balance sheet.
In 1997, JP Foodservice was generating about $2 billion in annual sales primarily focused on the east coast. Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice was generating $3.2 billion in annual sales from its national distribution network and its manufacturing divisions. After the merger, the combined Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice-JP Foodservice operating company generated $5 billion in annual sales in 1997.
In early 1998, the merged company Rykoff-Sexton-JP Foodservice changed its named to US Foodservice (USF) and dropped all Rykoff-Sexton-JP Foodservices brands and logos. In addition, US Foodservice focused exclusively on sales, marketing and distribution.
To help fund the merger, US Foodservice sold the Rykoff-Sexton Manufacturing Division (RSMD) to the private equity firm of Kohlberg & Company and RSMD senior management. RSMD manufactured over 1,400 food and non-food items and generated about $115 million in 1997. RSMD had manufacturing plants in Los Angeles (S.E. Rykoff & Co.), which manufactured non-food items such as detergents, cleaning compounds, refuse container liners, cutlery, straws and sandwich bags, paper napkins, placemats, chefs' hats, coasters, paper lace doilies and a line of low-temperature dishwashers. The plant in Englewood, New Jersey (Sexton Foods) manufactured coffee and spices. The 1800 Churchman Avenue plant in Indianapolis, Indiana (Sexton Quality Foods) manufactured more than 500 items including canned products, frozen products, refrigerated products, powdered products, shortenings/oils, dressings, sauces, syrups, flavorings, dry mixes, and soup bases. RSMD supplied Rykoff-Sexton/US Foodservice and also did some contract manufacturing for restaurant chains and other private label brands.
The new company would operate under the name United Signature Foods L.L.C. Prior to the purchase, Kohlberg & Company required US Foodservice to enter into a six-year supply contract with U.S. Foods LLC that increased 6% over the term. Gross proceeds from the supply agreement and asset sale totaled $101 million. Even with the sale of RSMD, some John Sexton & Co. signature products live on. For instance, US Foodservice still markets Alamo Zestful Seasonings, Jamaica Relish (developed by Sexton Food Chef Tony Bartolotta), Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing, and Kettle Rich soups.
In 2000, US Foodservice was acquired by Dutch grocer Royal Ahold for $26 per share or $3.6 billion and the assumption of all outstanding US Foodservice debt. In 2006, Ahold stated that US Foodservice was generating $19.2 billion in sales.
In 2007, Royal Ahold sold US Foodservice through a $7.2 billion leverage buyout conducted by Clayton, Dubilier and Rice and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR had purchased Beatrice Foods, once the owner of Sexton, in 1986). As of June 2007, US Foodservice is jointly owned by Clayton, Dubilier and Rice and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
In 2009, US Foodservice was still privately held, and was the second largest broadline foodservice distributor in the U.S. with $18.97 billion in revenue and 24,687 employees. SYSCO was the largest foodservice distributor.

Sky-Watcher

Sky-Watcher is a commercial distribution company established in 1999 by the Synta Technology Corporation of Taiwan (Synta Taiwan) that markets telescopes and astronomical equipment, like mounts and eyepieces, aimed at the amateur astronomical market. The products are manufactured at Synta Taiwan's Suzhou Synta Optical Technology Co., Ltd. in Suzhou (Jiangsu), China. The brand is distributed in Canada and Europe and, in the late 2000s, extended to the USA market.
In 1999, the brand "Sky-Watcher" was established to sell Synta Taiwan's optics with head offices in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. From 2000, the first dobsonians were produced, then in 2001 the first Maksutov-Cassegrains, and in 2004 their first Apochromat ED-APO refracting telescopes. Since 2008, there has been cooperation with Schott AG, a German manufacturer of high-quality industrial glass.
Sky-Watcher's product line-up contains telescopes from 2.4“ (60 mm) up to 16“ (406 mm) aperture with manual, motor-driven or GoTo mounts. Since 2008, Sky-Watcher has manufactured dobsonians with collapsible tubes, a product line they call FlexTube-dobsonians.
Products include telescopes, spotting scopes, mounts, and many accessories.
Sky-Watcher has eleven model series of telescopes. These are listed below.
Esprit 80ED, 100ED, 120ED and 150ED Super APO refractors have a doublet field flattener to get a flat field and minimize aberration and distortion. Their wide 48mm opener ensures a larger and clearer aperture and also extremely minimized halation. Connect the triplet and doublet field flattener with a high precision thin thread to keep the optical axis perpendicular to the image.
The Equinox series are relatively affordable Extra-low Dispersion (ED) apochromatic refractors in Optical Tube Assembly (OTA) between 66 mm and 120 mm (2.60" - 4.72"), suitable for astrophotography. The smaller apertures have medium focal ratios and the larger ones have long focal ratios. These telescopes have black-colored tubes.
The pro series telescopes include two-element air-spaced OTA ED FPL-53 fluorite apochromatic refractors between 80 mm and 120 mm (3.15" - 4.72") with long focal ratios, also suitable for astrophotography, as well as OTA Maksutovs with very long focal ratios and apertures of 150 mm and 180 mm (5.91" and 7.09"). They are presented in Black Diamond tubes.
The refractors series are multi-coated achromatic refractors between 70 and 150 mm (2.76" - 5.91"). They are available in alt-azimuth mounting for smaller apertures, and equatorial mounting for larger ones. They have long focal ratios, and are constructed with a blue aluminum tube.
The Reflector series telescopes are reflectors with optics aluminized and overcoated with silicon dioxide, available in 76 mm to 254 mm sizes (2.99" – 10.00"). All but the smallest size are presented in equatorial mounting; the smallest one in Alt-azimuth. They are available in short, medium, and long focal ratios and chiefly parabolic mirrors. They are made with Black Diamond aluminum tubes. The 130 to 200 mm aperture parabolic mirror scopes are available with shorter tubes and dual speed Crayford focusers and are optimised for astrophotography.
Table top telescopes have a 13" (330 mm) high equatorial mount, designed to be extremely portable. They include a 130 mm (5.10") reflector and an 80 mm (3.15") refractor of short and medium focal lengths respectively, as well as a long-focal length 90 mm (3.54") Maksutov. They are presented in variable-colored tubes.
The Solid-tube (traditional) Dobsonians are Dobsonian-mounted Newtonian reflectors available in 153 mm (6"), 203 mm (8"), 254 mm (10"), and 305 mm (12") models. They have thin 0.5 mm (0.02")-thick secondary mirror supports, tension control handles, and the 10" - 12" version is made from Pyrex glass. They have long, medium, and short focal ratios respectively, in order of increasing aperture. They have white-colored tubes.
The Collapsible Dobsonians are Dobsonian-mounted Newtonian reflectors available in 200 mm (8"), 254 mm (10"), 305 mm (12") and 406 mm (16") models. They are similar in design to the Solid-Tube Dobsonians but have black-colored tubes with the middle section of the tube replaced with struts. The struts allow the top portion of the tube to collapse down on the bottom portion, decreasing the tube length when in storage or being transported. The Collapsible Dobsonians also feature Crayford focusers instead of the traditional rack and pinion focuser that was included with the Solid-tube Dobsonians.
The Short-tube Refractors series are multi-coated two-element air-spaced Rich Field achromatic refractors with focal ratios that allow them to have short and compact tube lengths. They are available in Alt-azimuth versions for smaller apertures and equatorial mounts for larger ones, and are available in 70 mm to 150 mm (2.76" - 5.91") apertures. They are presented with blue tubes, and are suited for terrestrial photography as well as astrophotography in the larger versions.
The Maksutov-Cassegrain telescopes are compact portable multi-coated Maksutov-Cassegrains. They are sold in equatorial mounts and are available in 90 – 180 mm (3.54" - 7") apertures. They have very long focal ratios and are sold in blue aluminum tubes. As with the Newtonians, newer ones can have the "Black Diamond" finish.
The auto-tracking series telescopes are motorized alt-azimuth telescopes, allowing the user to automatically track celestial objects. They are available in 70 mm and 80 mm (2.76" and 3.15") apertures for refractors with medium, long, and very long focal ratios, as reflectors with 76 mm and 114 mm (2.99" and 4.49") apertures and have long and short focal ratios respectively, as well as in 80 mm (3.15") Maksutov form with a very long focal ratio. They are sold in blue tubes with red-dot style reflector sight finders.
Sky-Watcher spotting scopes come in three different designs. Maksutov Spottings are sold as Maksutov telescopes available in 80 mm - 127 mm (3.15" – 5") apertures, and are sold as OTA with very long focal ratios and red-dot style reflector sight finders. They are constructed with blue tubes and include a carrying bag. ST1545 and ST2060 spotting scopes are wide-angle and available in 50 mm and 60 mm (1.97" and 2.36") sizes with 15-45x and 20-60x zoom respectively. They are sold with tripod attachment capability and a camera adapter and blue tubes. Digital spotting scopes are a multi-purpose digital camera, spotting scope, and telescope. They have a 70 mm (2.36") refractor design at 14x with zoom capability between 6x and 22x, and have many features including an optional solar filter, video capability, and a tripod adaptor.
Alt-azimuth mount: AZ1, AZ2, AZ3, and AZ4
Equatorial mount: EQ1, EQ2, EQ3, and EQ5
SynScan GoTo mount: EQ3 SynScan, EQ5 SynScan, HEQ5, EQ6, AZ-EQ5, AZ-EQ6 and EQ8

<doc id="14773644" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14773644" title="J. W. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd">
J. W. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd

J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd is a British firm of organ builders established in 1828 by Joseph William Walker in London. Walker organs were popular additions to churches during the Gothic Revival era of church building and restoration in Victorian Britain, and instruments built by Walker are found in many churches around the UK and in other countries. The firm continues to build organs today.
The firm was founded by Joseph William Walker (1802–1870), an apprentice to George Pike England. Walker established his own organ-building business in Soho, London in 1828, and moved later to Francis Street off Tottenham Court Road.
Notable initially for pleasing small church and barrel organs, Walker achieved a breakthrough with the order for a large three-manual instrument at Romsey Abbey, Hampshire in 1858, including a thirty-two foot Pedal Open Wood. This instrument was in 2007 substantially in its original state, a recent renovation confirming its outstanding musical qualities.
Walker died in 1870, and his youngest and only surviving son, James John Walker, took over the firm.
Arguably, the heyday of the company occurred towards the end of the nineteenth century under the leadership of James John Walker (1846–1922), the youngest and only surviving son of Joseph William. The company developed a reputation in the 1890s for excellence in massive diapason voicing using scales and pressures for flue work greater than those used by Hill or Willis. The effect was rolling and magnificent. Notable instruments included those in London at Holy Trinity Sloane Street and St Margaret's Westminster; cathedrals at York, Rochester and Bristol; and the organs at St Mary's, Portsea and St Matthew's Northampton. Walker also later rebuilt the Gray & Davison concert organ at the Crystal Palace, increasing its power to carry across the vast space of the central transept. The sequence of church instruments continued into the twentieth century, including the large instrument at the Roman Catholic church of The Sacred Heart, Wimbledon, built in 1912.
After James Walker's death, the reputation of the firm in the "first division" of British organ building lasted through the Second World War. By the 1960s, British organ design had become not only eclectic but, to some ears, meekly derivative. The rebuild at Wimborne Minster in 1965 incorporated pipework from earlier periods beginning in 1664; the old material was made to sit with elements in vogue at the time of the Walker rebuild to create an organ whose character could be said to be either of all its history or properly representative of none of it, except perhaps 1965 itself. Later commentators have levelled harsh words at the 1960s "Jack-of-all-trades" British pipe organ without realizing that for the players of the day, such innovations drawn from European practice entirely outside the original scheme and character of the instruments, did at least open new avenues for players just getting used to attempt, for example, baroque performance practice.
Given enough money, the Walker firm could produce impressive, cogent and exciting new work, as at Liverpool's new Catholic cathedral (1967–68). The instrument could be seen as a response to the existing (and outstanding) instrument by Henry Willis III at the neighbouring Anglican cathedral, and recordings by several outstanding European players, including Jeanne Demessieux and Flor Peeters, were made there.
Eventually, a recognizable revival came to the Walker firm with its move, in stages, from west London to the small town of Brandon, on the Suffolk/Norfolk border, where the organ building firm and a parts supply business ("P & S") occupied modern workshops. In the 1980s, under the leadership of Robert Pennells, his German (Klais)-trained son Andrew, B. Q. S. F. Buchanan and head voicer Michael Butler, a number of new and prestigious instruments were made, including town hall organs at Bolton in 1985 (after a fire four years before which destroyed a famous 1874 Gray & Davison instrument) and, leading a group of instruments for export, at Adelaide (1989); at Lancing College Chapel in 1986-7; and several years later at London's St Martin-in-the-Fields. The visual effect of a number of the new instruments benefited considerably from the case-designs of David Graebe. Later organs included a Cavaillé-Coll-inspired instrument, built in 1995 at Exeter College, Oxford.
In 1999, Andrew Pennells died, drawing his father out of retirement. Today, the business has four distinct parts under the umbrella of "The Walker Group": restoration work operating from premises in the Wiltshire town of Devizes; tuning, supplies to the trade and a small new-organbuilding practice in Brandon.
Maintenance of the organ at Waltham Abbey, installed in 1819 by Flight & Robson, was taken over by J. W. Walker in 1850. The company carried out a number of additions and reconstructions to it between then and 1953, including installing a replacement in 1879. In 1953 they "completely dismantled and rebuilt" it and resited the console at a cost of "under £7,000." Since 2003, this organ has been in the care of Harrison & Harrison of Durham. An appeal was launched in 2007 to raise £250,000 for a replacement organ.
The organ removed in 1879 could be the "fine Walker organ" said to have come from Waltham Abbey and to have made "an absolutely splendid sound". This instrument was installed at Little Clacton, Essex in 1939, and later sold on to Christ Church, Greenwich.

Genmab

Genmab A/S is a Danish biotechnology company, founded in February 1999 by Florian Schönharting, at the time managing director of BankInvest Biomedical venture fund.
Genmab is based in Copenhagen. Internationally, it operates through the subsidiaries Genmab BV in Utrecht, The Netherlands, and Genmab, Inc in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. The Company is publicly traded on the NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen A/S.
The company has two approved antibodies, Arzerra® (ofatumumab) for the treatment of certain chronic lymphocytic leukemia indications and DARZALEX™ (daratumumab) for the treatment of heavily pretreated or double refractory multiple myeloma. Daratumumab is in clinical development for additional multiple myeloma indications and for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. They also have a broad clinical and pre-clinical product pipeline.
Genmab's technology is licensed from Medarex to create fully human high affinity antibodies using transgenic mice. These antibodies are less likely to elicit an allergic reaction and other side effects compared with other types of man-made antibodies containing other animal proteins because the IgG antibodies produced have human proteins. 
This technology is called the HuMab-Mouse technology. One benefit of using this type of technology is that there is no need for humanization or complicated genetic engineering to make this antibody fit for humans which cuts down on expenses and time spent developing it. It can be generated within months and can be selected to bind to specific antigens such as tumor cells and other infectious agents.
Genmab also has developed its own technology called UniBody, which is used to make smaller antibodies in contrast to the traditional full sized monoclonal antibody. Its smaller size allows for better distribution over larger target areas like tumors. The UniBody can only bind to one site and doesn’t elicit a harmful immune response by binding to two sites and over-activating cell growth. It does not kill target cells but rather silences or inhibits them. Thus it can be used to treat certain cancers, inflammations, allergies and asthmas, where killing the cell isn’t the objective.
The technology modifies the human IgG4 antibody. Normally the IgG4 is considered inert and doesn’t elicit an immune response. However, they are also unstable and fall apart easily, which makes them unsuitable for therapeutic use. Genmab changes the shape of the IgG4 antibody by eliminating the hinge, the part of the antibody that creates the “Y” shape. This halves the antibody, creating a smaller version now known as their UniBody. This smaller version can only bind to one site and does not stimulate cancer cells to grow.
Genmab was founded as a European spin-off of American Biotech company Medarex in February 1999. Danish investment firm BankInvest, under Florian Schönharting, provided the seed investment for the company to start up in Copenhagen. Lisa Drakeman, a vice president at Medarex and wife of Donald Drakeman, Medarex's CEO and President at the time, was appointed CEO of Genmab upon incorporation. Like Medarex, Genmab began work producing monoclonal antibodies for life-threatening or debilitating diseases.
Rising quickly in the Biotech world, Genmab attracted many investors, especially venture capital firms. The company went public in October 2000, earning 1.56 billion Danish kroner, and had a second public offering in January 2006 yielding 800 million kroner. That same year, Genmab also had a licensing agreement with GlaxoSmithKline worth $1.6 billion for the antibody ofatumumab.
Besides GSK, Genmab also has licensing deals with Amgen, Roche and Lundbeck involving therapeutic monoclonal antibodies with multiple indications. In 2005 the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) and the Long Island Life Sciences Initiative honored Genmab with a James D. Watson Helix Award. The Company's first product, Arzerra (ofatumumab) reached the US market in 2009 for refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
In 2010 Jan Van de Winkel was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. Previously he was President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer and he has over 20 years of experience in the therapeutic antibody field and served as Vice President and Scientific Director of Medarex Europe prior to Genmab. He is the author of over 300 scientific publications and has been responsible for over 40 patents and pending patent applications.
Amgen: In May 1999, Genmab entered a sub-license agreement with Amgen where it would gain rights to the IL15 antibodies. In October 2001, this was replaced by a direct license agreement where Amgen retained exclusive commercialization options for the products through phase II. Amgen has also expanded its agreement to a new antibody program targeting additional disease targets. Amgen has discontinued development of the IL15 antibody, AMG 714, in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis based on disappointing results from recent clinical studies. Amgen is exploring options to maximize the value of this asset, but as this time, no further internal development of a lead indication is planned.
GlaxoSmithKline: In December 2006, Genmab entered a deal with GlaxoSmithKline to co-develop and commercialize ofatumumab, which is a drug that could be used for treatment in CD20 positive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis and other indications. The agreement gave Genmab a license fee of DKK 582 million and GSK bought 4,471,202 shares of Genmab for 2,033 million. The potential value of this agreement could be 12.0 billion DKK if all milestones are reached and commercial success is reached in the fields of cancer, autoimmune, and inflammatory disease. Until 2008, Genmab will bear the entire development cost, after which the costs will be shared equally between the two. Genmab and GSK amended the agreement in July 2010. GSK has taken responsibility for developing ofatumumab in autoimmune indications while continuing to jointly develop ofatumumab with Genmab in oncology indications. Genmab received an up front payment of GBP 90 million from GSK in relation to the amendment and the Company's future funding commitment is capped at GBP 145 million. Further milestones due to Genmab under the oncology development program will be reduced by 50%. GSK is now solely responsible for funding development in autoimmune indications and Genmab will forgo development milestones for autoimmune indications and the first two sales milestones.
In addition, Genmab has collaborations with Roche (RG1507, a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R, collaboration was terminated in 2009), Lundbeck and Seattle Genetics.
Status of Genmab's clinical pipeline, as of November 2015.

Carlsberg Srbija

Carlsberg Srbija (full legal name: "Carlsberg Srbija d.o.o. Čelarevo") is a Serbian beer brewery, based in Bačka Palanka, Serbia. It is majority owned by Danish Carlsberg Group since 2003 and it has around 600 employees. It is well known by its signature brand Lav pivo. According to data from 2012, Carlsberg Srbija holds 28.4% of Serbian beer market, placing it second, behind market leader Apatinska pivara.
The Belgrade-based Carlsberg South East Europe regional group oversees Carlsberg's operations in the Balkans (other than Čelarevo facility, Carlsberg owns several more breweries in Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania). In addition to its market presence in Serbia, Carlsberg Srbija exports its signature brand on the markets of Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Pivara Čelarevo was founded in 1892 by landowner Lazar Dunđerski. The beer it produced was called ČIB from the founding of the brewery till 1980, after the prior name of the place. Its capacity back then was about 10,000 hl a year. The brewery had its own malthouse as well, which stopped working in 1973 when first commercial malt house appeared. Until privatization, the brewery was a part of an agricultural property, therefore it was always able to provide necessary ingredients. It possessed its own hop fields covering around 100ha, where four kinds of hop were cultivated.
Significant technological development of the brewery started in the 1970s when new Steinecker fermentation hall was purchased, the capacity of which was 400,000 hl a year. It was not until 1978 that the first cylindrical conical fermentors in former Yugoslavia, made by stainless steel, were installed in open space. Two years later, a hall for two lines of filling beer into bottles was built, as well as a modern cooling system, installation for taking and filling of carbon-dioxide, line for pouring beer into barrels, new power unit, installation for chemical preparation and disinfection of water. In the eighties, new line for fruit juices started working.
In the nineties, to be more precise in 1992 a more updated, automated Steinecker fermentation hall was built in. Power unit was reconstructed, gas was introduced, Japanese compressors for ammonium cooling were purchased. Eight new fermentors made in Italy started work in 1996 which are cooled by direct vaporization of ammonium, which was the first time in Yugoslavia, and which rationalizes the expenditure of cooling energy. The four new ones were installed in 1998, and eight more in 2000. New, modern line for filling beer in glass bottles was installed in 2003.
Pivara Čelarevo has been under the patronage of Carlsberg Group owning 52 percent from September 2003, and from September 2004 the ownership has become 99.96 percent. Since then, one of the major investments in production has been purchasing of modern PET line of a renowned German producer Krones, which started working in June 2004. This increases the capacity for producing larger number of brands as well as the capacity of the brewery. In 2006. new CAN line was installed in Brewery producing and filling CAN beer for Carlsberg South East Europe region.
The company Carlsberg Srbija achieved the growth rate of 70 percent in 2005, which represented the largest growth rate in Serbia. Carlsberg Srbija is the first brewery to introduce on the Serbian market an internationally renowned brand of beer made in Serbia - TUBORG Green.
In its portfolio Carslberg Srbija has: LAV Pivo; LAV 7 Pivo; TUBORG Green; HOLSTEN and CARLSBERG.
On October 4, 2013, Gabor Bekefi has been appointed as a new CEO of the company, replacing Ralph Zigerlig in that position. He has already been a CEO of Carlsberg South East Europe since July 2010.
In December 2006, Carlsberg Srbija became the first brewery in Serbia, and also the first brewery within Carlsberg Group to obtain the ISO9001 and ISO22000 international certificates awarded by the Lloyd's Register Group.
In early March 2007, the company announced it started the production and bottling of Holsten pilsener at its facilities.
According to the August 2007 press release by Carlsberg Srbija CEO, the Carlsberg Group already invested €110 million in its Serbian operation since 2004, and has further plans to invest €15 million in order to expand its facilities that would allow it to increase its annual production to 2 million hl by May 2008.
In March 2008, the company announced the start of bottling and production of a new brand - Tuborg Lemon.
On October 22, 2008, the company opened the Beer Museum in Čelarevo.
Its promotional activities in Serbia are sizable. Since 2004, the company is the main sponsor of Serbian national football team, which it uses to promote its Lav brand. Since its inauguration in 2007, they also sponsor the Green Fest, annual summer single-day event that features performances by some of the biggest and best known performers in rock music. The company uses its presence at the festival to promote the Tuborg Green brand that's also produced and bottled at their facilities.
In 2003, when Carlsberg Group took the company, it had a 23% of market share. As of data from 2012, Carslberg Srbija increased its market share to 28.4%.
According to its most recent annual financial report submitted to Serbian Economic Register Agency, the company has 612 employees and it posted an annual net loss of RSD91,185,000 (approximately €0.79 million at the time) for the calendar year 2013.

GlobalSign

GlobalSign is a WebTrust-certified certificate authority (CAs) and provider of Identity Services.
Founded in Belgium in 1996 the company offers a diverse range of Identity service solutions.
GlobalSign provides PKI and Identity and Access Management services to provide enterprises with a platform to manage internal and external identities for the Internet of Everything. The services allow organizations to deploy secure e-services, manage employee and extended enterprise identities and automate PKI deployments for users, mobile, and machines.
GlobalSign's identity and access management portfolio includes access control, single sign-on (SSO), federation and delegation services to help organizations and service providers create new business models for customer and partner interactions.
GlobalSign's core PKI services allow its thousands of authenticated customers to conduct SSL-secured transactions, data transfer, distribution of tamper-proof code, and protection of online identities for secure email and access control. Additionally GlobalSign’s PKI services include a trusted root-chaining program for trusted PKI deployments, which allows the widely distributed and trusted GlobalSign root CA certificates to cryptographically chain subordinate root CAs for use in Microsoft CA and in other in-house CAs. Such chaining allows these non-commercial CAs to control their own internal PKI, typically issuing SSL and digital IDs for secure email and two-factor authentication.
GlobalSign’s solutions are designed to address the massive scalability demanded by the emerging $14.4 trillion Internet of Everything (IoE) market, where the ability to make secure networked connections - among people, processes, data and things - will require that every "thing" have a trusted identity that can be managed. The company has offices in the US, Europe and throughout Asia.
In November 2012 GlobalSign launched an online service that allows website administrators to confirm that they have correctly configured SSL across their websites and receive actionable guidance on how to remediate any faulty or exploitable SSL configurations.
In 2014 GlobalSign acquired Helsinki-based Ubisecure Solutions, Inc., a privately held identity and access management (IAM) software developer. The acquisition delivers essential technology and talent to propel GlobalSign’s strategic focus on identity services.
Ubisecure is recognized as a product leader in Access Management & Federation by Europe’s leading information security analyst firm KuppingerCole – a market that is expected to reach $7 billion by 2017. Ubisecure’s access control, single sign-on (SSO), federation and delegation services, along with massive scalability, are the product of a 53 man-year R&D investment. The software is used by an impressive number of government agencies, financial institutions and enterprises in Europe, and deployed with the help of over 150 strategic partners, including system integration leaders CapGemini and CGI.
GlobalSign is a founding member of the CA/B forum, a voluntary consortium of certification authorities, vendors of Internet browser software, operating systems, and other PKI-enabled applications that promulgates industry guidelines governing the issuance and management of X.509 v.3 digital certificates that chain to a trust anchor embedded in such applications.
GlobalSign is also a founding member of the Kantara Initiative and the Certificate Authority Security Council, a multi-vendor industry advocacy group created to conduct research, promote Internet security standards and educate the public on Internet security issues
GlobalSign has been recognized by the Online Trust Authority (OTA) as Web Compliant since 2001.
Additionally, Chief Product Officer Lila Kee is an executive member on the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB). Kee is a board member on the Wholesale Electrical Quadrant Board of Directors where she takes a lead role in the development of security best practices and standards needed to secure electric-industry wholesale business applications.
GlobalSign was the first CA to improve revocation checking for HTTPS pages through the use of a CDN.
The company was also the first to offer IPv6 compliant revocation services.
In September 2011, GlobalSign suspended issuing authentication certificates temporarily after an anonymous hacker compromised their servers. An Iranian student self-identified as "Comodohacker", who also claimed responsibility for the 2011 Comodo and DigiNotar breaches, claimed that he had also hacked the systems of GlobalSign. GlobalSign took the claim seriously enough to halt the signing/issuing of new certificates while investigating the claims; it resumed issuing certificates a week later.
Dutch security company Fox-IT was contracted to analyze the breach and GlobalSign released a security incident report. On December 13, 2011 GlobalSign released its final report on the incident. The report concluded that while GlobalSign's own web server was breached and the certificate of this server was stolen, due to the air gap separating this web server from the certificate-issuing machine (the one holding the company's root certificate), there was no evidence of any rogue certificates issued or any customer data exposed, thus the remedial actions were limited to cancelling their own web server's certificate and patching its software. Sophos’s Chester Wisniewski summarized the report and GlobalSign’s response to the incident on his blog and concluded "Not only is the report thorough and convincing, but it appears that GlobalSign took every action, exactly as they should have, both during and after the incident."

Blue Tree (boutique)

Blue Tree is a boutique on the Upper East Side of New York City, which was opened by former actress Phoebe Cates.
The store sells jewelry, clothing, antiques, perfume, candles, art, photography, books, vintage LPs, and stuffed animals.
The "New York Times" referred to the store as "a version of Elizabeth Street for the Carnegie Hill crowd, a little oasis of downtown aesthetic at Ladies Who Lunch prices," and said that "the celebrity boutique is a way for famous people to admit the civilian into their universe; it is a presentation of themselves, their likes and desires, their preferences—and does not require them to step in front of a camera."
Cates feels just as happy working at the store as she felt when she was making movies. She stated, "I always wanted to have a general store." Cates also said that some of her customers tell her that she looks like Phoebe Cates, and that she responds to them by saying, "I get that a lot."
The name of the store was suggested by Cates' husband, Kevin Kline. The store's name is a reference to the blue trees in Fauvist paintings—with the idea being that just as blue trees seem out of place in a forest, a store like Blue Tree seems out of place on the Upper East Side.
One popular item at the store is a talking Abraham Lincoln doll. Although it was created as an educational tool for children, it ended up being a popular gift among seniors.

United States National Bank of Galveston

The United States National Bank of Galveston [USNB] was a federally chartered bank in Galveston, Texas. It was founded in 1874 and was merged into Frost National Bank in 2000. It was the last of 33 banks chartered in the US that used the forbidden title "United States" in its name.
The bank was founded in 1874 by the Kempner family as Island City Savings Bank. In 1902 the decision was made to rename the bank the Texas Bank & Trust Company. Finally, on December 31, 1923 the bank would receive its last name, United States National Bank.
The Galveston bank would be the last to be chartered using this name, as in 1926 the United States Congress banned the use of the words "Reserve", "United States" and "Federal" in bank titles. Under a grandfather clause, banks that already had titles incorporating those words were allowed to keep them.
On May 3, 1982, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. issued shares of common and redeemable preferred stock for all of the outstanding preferred and common stock of United States National Bancshares, Inc. and Galbank, Inc. which together owned all of the capital stock of United States National Bank of Galveston and Sugar Land State Bank.
Afterwards Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. continued to operate United States National Bank (USNB) separately from its flagship Frost National Bank for nearly two decades. As new financial services legislation allowed banks to broaden the services they offered customers, Cullen/Frost folded the USNB charter into Frost's in 2000. With this action, the last bank using the federally forbidden "United States National Bank" title ceased to exist.

Bolsover Colliery Company

The Bolsover Colliery Company was a major mining concern established to extract coal from land owned by the Duke of Portland. At its peak the business was a constituent of the FT 30 index of leading companies on the London Stock Exchange.
The company was founded in 1889 by Emerson Muschamp Bainbridge, a Northumberland born mine owner, who secured a lease from the Duke of Portland for land at Bolsover in Derbyshire and started shaft sinking to reach the coal in 1891. The general manager of the company at this time was John Plowright Houfton, who was knighted for his work for the local community in 1929.
Bainbridge secured the rights to mine coal at Creswell in 1894 and shaft sinking for Creswell Colliery began under the direction of J. P. Houfton in September that year. Coal was reached at 450 yards and production began in 1897. The colliery had two shafts and access to between three and four square miles of coal reserves. By 1901 the colliery was producing 2700 to 3000 tons of coal daily and in the July, 3001 tons was delivered to the surface in one day, a world record for coal production at the time. A model village was built to accommodate some of the workforce.
In 1899 Bainbridge secured a further lease from the Duke of Portland for land at Crown Farm near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire: coal was reached in 1905.
Subsequent leases were secured from Earl Manvers and Lord Savile allowing collieries to be established at Rufford, Clipstone and Thoresby in Nottinghamshire where coal was reached 1913, 1922 and 1928 respectively.
In 1933 the company's Bolsover, Clipstone, Creswell, Mansfield, Rufford and Thorsby Collieries employed 9,369 men extracting 4.5 million tons of coal from the Top Hard, Waterloo and High Hazel seams.
The company's collieries were acquired by the National Coal Board on nationalisation in 1947. Bolsover Colliery closed in 1993 and Creswell Colliery closed in 1991.

European x-ray free electron laser

The European x-ray free electron laser (European XFEL) is an X-ray research laser facility currently under construction and is scheduled to start user operation in 2017. The international project with 11 participating countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) is located in the German federal states of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein. A free-electron laser generates high-intensity electromagnetic radiation by accelerating electrons to relativistic speeds and directing them through special magnetic structures. The European XFEL is constructed such that the electrons produce x-ray light in synchronisation, resulting in high-intensity x-ray pulses with the properties of laser light and at intensities much brighter than those produced by conventional synchrotron light sources.
The 3.4 km long tunnel for the European XFEL housing the superconducting linear accelerator and photon beamlines will run 6 to 38 m underground from the site of the DESY research center in Hamburg to the town of Schenefeld in Schleswig-Holstein, where the administrative buildings and experimental stations and laboratories will be located.
Electrons will be accelerated to an energy of up to 17.5 GeV by a 2.1 km long superconducting linear accelerator. The electrons are then introduced into the magnetic fields of special arrays of magnets called undulators, where they follow curved trajectories resulting in the emission of x-ray radiation in the range of 0.05 to 4.7 nanometres.
The x-ray light will be generated by Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE), where electrons interact with the radiation that they or their neighbours emit. The result is spontaneous emission of tightly bunched packages of radiation that are amplified like laser light. The peak brilliance of the European XFEL will be billions of times higher than that of conventional x-ray light sources, the average brilliance being 10,000 times higher. The facility will also produce many more (up to 27,000) pulses per second than similar projects in the US and Japan, which is achieved by adopting the superconducting linear accelerator technology developed at DESY.
The duration of the light pulses will be less than a few femtoseconds, making it possible to measure chemical reactions that are too rapid to be captured by other methods. The wavelength of the x-ray laser may be varied from 0.05 to 6 nanometers, enabling measurements at the atomic length scale.
Initially, 3 photon beamlines with a total of 6 experimental stations (later to be upgraded to 5 photon beamlines and 10 experimental stations) are foreseen. The proposed experimental beamlines will enable unique scientific experiments exploiting the high intensity, coherence and time structure of the new source to be conducted in a variety of disciplines spanning physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and nanotechnology.
The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research granted permission to build the facility on 5 June 2007 at a cost of 850 million Euro, under the provision that it should be financed as a European project. Following the 6-year construction period, commissioning of the facility will begin in 2016/2017.
In 2007, the European XFEL project was officially launched and the European XFEL GmbH that will build and operate the facility has been founded in 2009. Civil construction of the facility began on 8 January 2009. Construction of the tunnels was completed in summer 2012, and all underground construction was completed the following year. The overall cost for the construction and commissioning of the facility is estimated at 1.22 billion Euros (price levels of 2005).

<doc id="14821471" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14821471" title="Micron (skate company)">
Micron (skate company)

Micron produced ice hockey equipment in the 1980s and were based in Canada. The company was eventually purchased by Bauer Hockey in 1994.
They were probably best known for their 'Mega' range of ice skates and most notably the Micron Mega 10-90, Micron Mega 10-70 and Micron Mega 10-50.
They invented "Power Clip" technology, which they claimed to give increased power to the skater. The "Power Clip" was a white plastic square attached to the sole of the boot on the inside of the foot and had the first three (for small-medium sizes) or four (for large sizes) lace holes of the boot in it.
The design of the boots made the skater lean forward slightly when skating which company claimed improved balancing of weight when skating backwards. They were often used by ice hockey players that played defence. 
The 10-50 versions were the mid-range junior skates (sizes 1–5) and 10-70s were the mid-range adult skates (sizes 6 and up). They were comparable to the Daoust 301 or the Bauer 200/300 series and used similar construction materials. The 10-90 model came in two completely different configurations: Street and Pro. Within the Pro version there were two configurations: an early, initial version and a later modified second, final version. The early version of the 10-90 PRO (red stripe) was distinguished by a white chevron on the ankle-quarter area. On the final modified version, the chevron was black and there was a small notch added to the lace hole area between the third and fourth eyelets, intended to improve front to rear ankle movement. Also added was an improved tongue. 
The Mega 10-90 came in two versions: The retail store "street" version and the specialty store "Pro" version, distinguished by the red stripe down the side of the skate boot. The Pro versions were priced at $350–$400 in the early 1990s, and came with a pro level rear quarter package and a thicker tongue. The Pro version was available with either the one-piece ICM holder (lower price option) and carbon steel blade combo or the TUUK holder that provided the option of using V2 stainless blades (highest price option) or standard stainless steel blades. The V2 blades, which were only available for two years in the early 1990s, were about half the thickness of a standard blade and very similar to that used by Olympic speed skaters. At the front or toe end (1–1.5 inches) of the blade, the steel was regular thickness, which the company claimed provided a "kick" when changing direction or starting from a dead stop. Due to high cost (and high selling price) to produce these blades and the poor acceptance at the pro level, they were eventually discontinued.
The Micron Mega 10-90 Pro version also had an inner boot with soft lambskin leather and memory-gel ankle padding. The 10-90s were available in a wide range of widths as they catered to the high-end player who wanted an exact fit. They were particularly designed for taller, heavier skaters.
Micron Mega 10-90 skates were used at various points by such NHL players as Mario Lemieux, Ray Bourque, Cam Neely, Pavel Bure and Bernie Nicholls.
The Mega 10-90 Pro version skates remain sought after for play and by collectors 15 years after being discontinued. Nike, Inc. bought out Bauer-Canstar in the late 1990s. The replacement skate for the 10-90 was the Canstar-Bauer Mega Air 90 (the term mega was dropped the following year). Bauer did not use the "last" or basic footbead of the original Micron Mega 10-90 in the production of the Bauer Mega Air 90 or the Bauer Air 90.

<doc id="14826516" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14826516" title="SIDALC">
SIDALC

The Agricultural Information and Documentation Service of the Americas (SIDALC) is an international agricultural, livestock, forestry and environmental information service in which institutions in 23 countries of the Americas share information and services on line. Created in 1999, today it is one of the most important sources of knowledge and information in LAC{what is that?}.
It provides access to information generated throughout the hemisphere and stored in libraries and other related information centers. It contains some two million reference materials including books, magazines and journals, graduate theses, reports, audiovisual materials, maps and photographs.
At present, the SIDALC information system is open to the public at www.sidalc.net (no subscription required), which also permits on-line searches of available digital collections, including full texts, audiovisual materials, photographs, etc. Furthermore, SIDALC is linked to other information systems in a number of countries of the Americas, which provide stakeholders in agriculture and rural territories with access to relevant information and knowledge.
SIDALC's provides access to the intellectual capital of at least 166 national institutions. It is the result of earlier initiatives aimed at management of knowledge and information, all promoted by IICA, such as the Orton Commemorative Library (founded in 1943); the Scientific Exchange Service (SIC), created in 1958; the Inter-American Association of Agricultural Librarians, Documentalists and Information Specialists (AIBDA), founded in 1965; and the Inter-American Agricultural Information System (AGRINTER), created in 1972.
SIDALC was created thanks to a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, to the technical leadership assumed by IICA and CATIE and to the participation of a number of national, regional and international organizations.
SIDALC is a community of agricultural, forestry and other information specialists located in different institutions of the Americas interested in providing services openly. They collaborate with one another, “sharing a little so that all can have more,” while conserving their identity and their policies on providing specialized services at no cost or for a fee.
That is greatest competitive advantage of SIDALC. With a hemispheric system to which more than 20 national information systems are linked it is possible to provide access to specialized knowledge on agriculture and rural life in the Americas and to share it with the world.
Also, through SIDALC, it is possible to mobilize human and information resources among countries and regions, promoting and supporting national information management initiatives, facilitating the flow of information and promoting the dissemination and transfer of successful experiences.
– Participation in the largest hemispheric information system specializing in agriculture and rural life in the Americas
– Linkage to international information system, essential for accrediting the quality of institutional services, such as university majors
– Recognition, nationally and internationally, of the networks and libraries and other related information centers
– Increase in the demand for services on the part of users, and the positive impact on the reference services of specialized libraries
– Access to a larger collection of specialized information on agriculture, the environment, forestry and related areas; the AGRI2000 mega base
– Open access to tools and methodologies for the management of specialized information
– Exchanges of experiences with specialists and institutions, which helps identify opportunities and find solutions to specific problems
– International backing of institutional catalogues
– Greater visibility, at the international level, of institutional collections through SIDALC.NET and Google.com, without the institute losing its identity.
– A "community of practice" made up of specialists in information management
– A directory of national networks, libraries and other information centers in Latin America and the Caribbean specializing in agriculture and rural life
– The AGRI2000 mega base, which contains collections specializing in agriculture, environment, forestry and related areas, with references and electronic resources of all types: texts, audiovisual materials, photographs, maps, etc.
– A direct link to the National Agricultural Library of the United States, the Agricultural Library of Canada, the Agriculture Network Information Center AGNIC in the United States, the CGIAR virtual library and the AGRIS global system promoted by FAO
– Access to different agricultural information systems available via Internet, as well as to resource centers and specialized packages of agricultural and rural information from LAC
– A platform for sharing information management services among countries, and contacting directly the units that provide reference services in the most important specialized libraries of LAC.
See IICA 
The Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) recognizes that the management of information and knowledge is fundamental for improving agriculture and rural life in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Both information and knowledge are essential in decision making, in the fields of education and innovation, and in achieving competitiveness and sustainable development.

The Editora Globo (Globo Editors) is a Brazilian publishing house, property of Fundação Roberto Marinho. It began as a bookstore called Livraria do Globo, created in Porto Alegre, in December 1883, by Laudelino Pinheiro de Barcellos and Saturnino Alves Pinto.
The bookstore "Livraria do Globo" begun as in a little store located at "Rua da Praia" Number 268. The bookstore was open daily from 6:30 am to 10:00 pm, including Saturdays. With a little business success, the bookstore started working as a copy and paperwork center, making bookbidings and other small services and the building where it was located underwent a slight remodeling.
Its first branch store was created in Santa Maria, near the old ferryway center of Rio Grande do Sul. The "Livraria do Globo's" owners decided to create an own magazine, called "Revista do Globo".
In the 1940s, the bookstore company reached its top success, with three branch stores in Brazil's South Region and offices in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. In 1986, the bookstore was sold to Rio Gráfica Editora, property of Fundação Roberto Marinho, that decided to rename its publishing house to Editora Globo, which continues as the current name.
These are the main titles published by Editora Globo (books are not included because there are innumerous titles published on many different subjects):
Have been published 1002 books and 69 collections.

Chambers Harrap

Chambers Harrap Publishers (Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd) is a reference publisher formerly based in Edinburgh, Scotland, which held the property rights of the venerable W.R. Chambers Publishers and its competitor George G. Harrap and Company (founded: 1901).
Chambers was founded as "W. & R. Chambers Publishers" by the two brothers William Chambers of Glenormiston and Robert Chambers. They were born into a rich, mill-owning family in Peebles in Scotland in 1800 and 1802 respectively, during the time of the war with France. The war impoverished the family and, in 1813, the family left Peebles for Edinburgh. Robert remained at home to finish his education, but William was forced to find work to support his parents. He was a keen reader and would get up early in the morning to read by the dawn light because he was too poor to buy candles. He was apprenticed to a bookseller, at the sum of 4 shillings a week. Robert, also an avid reader, could not go to university when he finished school because his parents could not afford to pay. He too moved to Edinburgh, rented a one-roomed shop in Leith Walk, and set himself up as a bookseller when he was just 16 years old. William's apprenticeship came to an end when he turned 18 and he joined Robert working in the shop.
Although they had had a modest beginning, the brothers began to do well. They had no training in printing and binding but together they printed, bound and published 750 copies of "The Songs of Robert Burns" in around 1819. This was the nearest thing to a guaranteed best-seller in 19th-century Edinburgh, and brought further profits and some fame.
In 1824, Robert wrote, and the brothers published, "Traditions of Edinburgh". Education was always the main priority for William and Robert. In 1832, they published "The Chambers Journal", a weekly newspaper containing articles on subjects such as history, religion, language and science, many of which were written by Robert himself. It was an immediate success and within a few years the weekly circulation had risen to 84,000 copies. This put an end to their struggle to survive although they still had to work hard.
Between 1859 and 1868 they published their most important work to date, the renowned Chambers's Encyclopaedia (no longer published) in 520 weekly parts at three-halfpence each. The first edition was based on a translation into English of the 10th edition of the German-language "Konversations-Lexikon", which became the Brockhaus Enzyklopädie. This went through several further editions, reaching a high point of quality with the 1950 edition published in 15 volumes by George Newnes which took six years to prepare, cost £500,000 and included the work of over 2,300 authors. The work was lauded by the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Jowitt, as "outstanding proof" of British scholarship, while the managing editor, M. D. Law, commented that she believed the work to be the first major encyclopaedia to be published in Britain since before the First World War. The encyclopaedia was regarded as such a scholarly achievement that Law received the O.B.E. for her efforts.
Chambers also published an extensive list of innovative and ultra-reliable language and reference titles, covering English-language dictionaries, thesauruses, bilingual dictionaries, and specialist titles on subjects such as biography, quotations, literary characters, science and technology and world history.
At the end of 2009, the parent company shut the Edinburgh premises of Chambers Harrap Publishers. The Chambers imprint is now managed from London by Hodder Education, while Harrap titles are edited in Paris. A subsidiary, Allied Chambers, publishes the titles for the market in and around India.
Chambers Harrap Publishers is best known for its flagship title, "The Chambers Dictionary", which contains more words and definitions than any other single-volume dictionary and is known for its occasionally humorous definitions. The Chambers list is currently split into the following areas:
Chambers purchased the formerly independent Harrap's in the early 1990s. Harrap mainly publishes bilingual dictionaries, for instance "Harrap's Shorter French Dictionary". The Harrap list also includes study aids, slang dictionaries, phrasebooks and business dictionaries. In the UK, Harrap publishes bilingual titles in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German and Polish.
Recently, Chambers has started selling Harrap publications under the "Chambers" imprint. It is not known whether the name "Harrap's" will continue in use.
At the end of 2007 Chambers Harrap Publishers acquired the rights to publish the renowned British slang lexicographer Jonathon Green's Slang Dictionary as "Chambers Slang Dictionary", originally published by Cassell of the Orion Publishing Group. This new edition was published in October 2008.
On 1 January 2008, Chambers Harrap Publishers acquired the Brewer's list from Orion Publishing Group, including the famous "Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable".

Tata Hispano

Tata Hispano Motors Carrocera, S.A. (formerly Hispano Carrocera, S.A.), based in Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain, was one of the largest manufacturers of bus and coach cabins in Europe. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of the India-based Tata Motors. Tata Motors acquired control of the company in 2005, after purchasing a 21% stake in the company. In 2009, it acquired the remaining 79% from Investalia SA.
Apart from their main plant in Zaragoza, Hispano had a second one in Casablanca, Morocco; combined, they had a production capacity of 2,000 units in a year. Tata intends to keep the Moroccan plant open.
Hispano bodied buses are built by TATA Motors in India at ACGL plant in Goa. The bus is called Tata Divo.
The company was founded in 1947 by D. Vincenzo Angelino Gervasio (an engineer of Neapolitan origin) and his wife Felisa Pueyo as Talleres Nápoles in Zaragoza, Spain. It was originally devoted to repairs, welding and metalwork on post-war trucks, but the company also developed its own design for a "unique truck cabin", which could be mounted on any chassis, and which was very successful. This success allowed the company to expand and move to a 3,000 m2 workshop, where it built its first bus in 1958 and its first double-decker bus in 1960. In 1962, the company moved again to newly built installations on the N-II road, becoming Factorías Nápoles, S.A., and begins to sell vehicles under its own brand, "Nazar" (an conflation of "Naples" and "Zaragoza"), in Spain and abroad. But in 1964, financial problems force the founder, Vicenzo Angelino, to leave the company, which changed its name again to Fabricaciones Industriales S.A.. In 1966, the company became part of Barreiros Diesel, S.A., which was in turn purchased by Chrysler in 1969, forming Chrysler España, S.A.. The bus and bodywork part of Chrysler España was then sold to Van Hool España, S.A. in 1971, which was later renamed to Hispano Carrocera, S.A.L. in 1983. The company manufactured Van Hool buses under license until developing the Hispano Carrocera brand in the late 1980s.
In 2005, sensing an opportunity in the fully built bus segment, Tata Motors from Mumbai acquired a 21% stake in Hispano Carrocera SA. In 2009, the Tata acquired the remaining 79% of in Hispano Carrocera for an undisclosed sum, making it a fully owned subsidiary, subsequently renamed Tata Hispano.
In September 2013, Tata announced the closure of the Zaragoza factory. It said sales had fallen and that future prospects for its marketplace were poor.
Major competitors of Tata Hispano include:

UTV Software Communications

UTV Software Communications Ltd. or UTV is an Indian media and entertainment company owned by The Walt Disney Company.
UTV started off as United Television Software Communications Pvt. Ltd. on 22 June 1990. The company later went public and was renamed UTV Software Communications Ltd. in 1998.
The UTV Group was incorporated as 'United Television Software Communications Private limited' on 22 June 1990; under the Companies Act, 1956 as a Private Limited Company. Subsequently, it became a deemed Public Limited Company and the word Private was deleted on 27 November 1995. It was renamed 'UTV Software Communications Limited' with effect from 19 March 1998.
At the time of incorporation, the group was primarily engaged in the production of television content for Doordarshan- Prasar Bharti and also production of ad films. In 1992, with the entry of satellite TV, ZEE TV commissioned the group for producing content of around 250 hours wherein it became one of the largest content providers. Around the same time, it also expanded into the businesses of in-flight entertainment programming and dubbing. In 1993, it ventured into the business of acquiring programs from outside producers and marketing airtime on their programs. In 1995, it launched a daily soap titled 'Shanti.'
In May 1995, it acquired 54.60% stake in Laezer Production Private Limited to enter into the area of post-production. Laezer Production Private Limited was incorporated on 29 January 1982. On becoming a deemed Public Limited Company, the word 'Private' was deleted on 27 November 1995. Subsequent to the acquisition of 54.60% stake by the UTV Group, Laezer Production Limited was renamed as UTV Studios Limited in December 1995. At that point of time United Studios Limited (USL) was engaged in the business of providing post-production facilities to television software houses, private producers and advertisers.
In 1996, Disney contracted the UTV Group to dub its library into Indian languages. In 1996, the company’s In-flight Entertainment division, which was catering to Air India only, started catering to other international airlines.

The animation division in USL was called RM-USL and thereafter was rechristened as UTV Toons and remained as a division of USL.

In 2002-03, the group acquired the studio business of Western Outdoor Media Technologies Limited (WOMTL) to attain leadership position in the Post-Production, Special Effects and Animation business. The Studio operations of WOMTL were thus merged with the group’s post-production business.
Since 2000-01, the UTV Group has initiated a corporate restructuring exercise to consolidate their holdings in certain group companies and subsidiaries. The objective of these exercises was to maximize shareholder value, remove conflict of interest and build a powerful combined entity.

Between 2007 and 2011, UTV was targeted for acquisition by studios in the USA and the UK. Fuse Global, global media fund had approached and made several attempts to play a role in becoming a financier to the studio, but it never materialised for Asian media billionaire Keyur Patel who has also done similar large format deals in USA.
In 2011, Disney offered to buy out stakes held by public shareholders and other promoters of the company in a deal valued around Rs 20 billion (USD $297 Million).

Australian National Industries

Australian National Industries Limited was an Australian heavy engineering company with diverse range of holdings.
Australian National Industries Limited had its origins in 1911 when John McGrath Industries Limited became one of the earliest garages in Australia selling and servicing motor vehicles. By the late 1940s, ANI had developed into a small steel forging, merchandising and engineering company. By 1985 it had become a multi-faceted corporation with operations throughout Australia and Overseas. ANI was incorporated in NSW and activities included contracting, distribution, manufacturing and service. Total sales were in excess of $1 billion in (1985) and in this year ANI achieved its 18th consecutive year of continuous profit growth. Profit after tax was $46 million in 1985 on sales of $1,095.4 million and this was a 9% increase on the previous year.
In 1985 ANI was reported to own 45% of Spedley Holdings. Spedley Holdings operated a merchant bank, Spedley Securities Limited which, in turn, owns the official short-term money market operator First Federation Discount Company Limited. and a London-based foreign exchange and currency broker in the international finance market. (1985). As of the 31st of October 1984, total assists of the Spedley group amounted to $460 million, however, Spedley collapsed only a few years later.
Businessman Kerry Packer became the dominant shareholder in ANI in April 1989, buying 48% of its stock after the share price had crashed to $1.40, following the disastrous, secret relationship with the collapsing Spedley Corporation, which cost ANI $200 million. 
In 1991, Packer's private company, Consolidated Press, sold ABT, a struggling European waste management company, to ANI for $2 million, a decision which was not disclosed to ANI shareholders. Two weeks later, Packer, who had already reduced his shareholding in ANI from 48% to 30%, sold his remaining 30% stake, making a $200 million profit. ABT had signed a contract to build a $150 million waste treatment facility in Madrid which some observers thought was more likely to cost about $400 million. In 2006, it was estimated that the final losses from ANI's venture into European waste management approached $1 billion.
Bob Ellicott QC was commissioned to conduct an independent enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the sale of ABT to ANI, but his report was never made public by the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, because the ANI board claimed it was defamatory.
Smorgon Steel purchased ANI for $850 million in 1998-99.
The struggling company was taken over by Smorgon Steel Group Limited and subsequently delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange on the 17 March 1999.

RTÉ Sport

RTÉ Sport is a department of Irish public broadcaster RTÉ. The department provides sporting coverage through a number of platforms including RTÉ Radio, RTÉ Television, RTÉ.ie, RTÉ Player Sport and RTÉ Mobile. RTÉ holds the television and radio broadcasting rights in the Republic of Ireland to several sports, broadcasting the sport live or alongside flagship analysis programmes such The Sunday Game, Thank GAA It's Friday, Soccer Republic and RTÉ Racing on RTÉ Television and Game On, Saturday Sport, Sunday Sport on RTÉ Radio.
Traditionally "RTÉ Sport" faced competition from British-based broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV which have always been present in Ireland, however these broadcasters were primarily concerned with the British public and market. Domestically, RTÉ had no competition until the late 1990s due to lack of competition in the Irish market. In latter years however a growth of variety in the Irish market opened competition between other broadcasters most notably with TG4 and Setanta Sports but also TV3. RTÉ Sport is also in competition with other European broadcasters such as Eurosport, ESPN, Sky Sports in addition to BBC Sport and ITV Sport. Despite competition in sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup final which is also available on RTÉ Sport remains Ireland's premier and most popular sports broadcaster.
Ryle Nugent is the current head of RTÉ Sport having been appointed in 2010.
On television RTÉ Two is the home of live sporting action broadcasting the majority of RTÉ's sports content. Sport may also be broadcast on RTÉ One but this is mainly due to scheduling issues.
RTÉ Sport currently holds the rights to a large portfolio of football tournaments including:
The Republic of Ireland matches were shown live on the channel for UEFA Euro 2004, 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2008, for all of which, they failed to qualify. Sky Sports got exclusive rights to Irish matches in the early 2000s and there were fears that National team matches couldn't be seen by fans so the government stepped in and now all Irish home and away qualifying matches have to be shown on Irish free to air TV meaning either RTÉ, TV3 or TG4 and have remained on RTÉ as well as Sky Sports. Irish Home friendlies were exclusive to Sky from 2000 and from 2014 on Premier Sports / Setanta Ireland with highlights broadcast on either RTÉ or TV3.
RTÉ Sport broadcasts a lot of association football tournaments. It showed 64 live games in the 2010 FIFA World Cup and that was 200 hours of programming.
These were the team of association football pundits that RTÉ Sport announced ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Apart from Ossie Ardiles, Dietmar Hamann and Kevin Kilbane, both made their debuts, and Liam Brady who has recently left his post assisting Ireland manager Giovanni Trapattoni, the rest were all regulars on RTÉ Sport's association football programming. The 2010 FIFA World Cup was the ninth for both Bill O'Herlihy and George Hamilton.
For the 2014 FIFA World Cup the RTÉ team was announced on 5 May 2014. The live coverage was presented by 
Bill O'Herlihy & Darragh Maloney with highlights presented by Tony O'Donoghue. The pundits for the tournament were RTÉ regulars John Giles, Liam Brady, Eamon Dunphy, Kenny Cunningham, Richie Sadlier & Ronnie Whelan. Guest pundits joining the coverage include Didi Hamann, Ossie Ardiles, Neil Lennon & Brad Friedel. Commentary comes from George Hamilton, Stephen Alkin, Adrian Eames & Peter Collins while co-commentators included Ray Houghton, Trevor Steven, Jim Beglin & Brian Kerr.
This was Bill O'Herlihy's final World Cup for RTÉ and his 11th World Cup for the broadcaster. Hamann & Ardiles both worked for RTÉ at the last world cup in 2010 while Lennon & Friedel are both working for the BBC at the World Cup and Jim Beglin rejoins RTÉ after leaving ITV in 2013.
RTÉ cover at least one match per week from the FAI League, these matches are usually hosted by Peter Collins or Tony O'Donohue with guests from Irish football such as Richie Sadlier, Kenny Cunningham, Roddy Collins. Commentary comes from Stephen Alkin, Adrian Eames, John Kenny, Ger Canning or George Hamilton.
"The Premiership" was RTÉ's flagship Premier League programme until 2008, when "Premier Soccer Saturday" was launched. "The Premiership" was shown on Saturday nights at 7.30pm. There were sometimes "Premiership Specials" which would normally be shown on a Sunday evening at 8.00pm or on a Monday night. These programmes are hosted usually by Darragh Maloney or Peter Collins with analysis mainly by Kenny Cunningham, Johnny Giles, Ronnie Whelan, Richie Sadler, Liam Brady, Trevor Steven, Graeme Souness or Matt Holland. "Premier Soccer Saturday" was dropped from RTÉ's schedules from the 2013 season.

The RTÉ Sport football division has achieved cult status due to it unintentional humour that is incorporated. With the main team of Bill O'Herlihy, John Giles, Eamon Dunphy and Liam Brady usually used for Irish matches and Champions League matches with a usual big build up and long analysis afterwards which gains huge ratings.
In 1926, RTÉ broadcast the first field game in Europe. The GAA match was live on the radio, 2RN, RTÉ's predecessor. RTÉ Sport is probably the second most significant of the categories since often hundreds of thousands would watch "The Sunday Game", with probably more than a million watching on the day of the All-Ireland Final.
RTÉ GAA coverage is the cornerstone of their sports coverage. RTÉ previously held the exclusive rights for television and radio in the Republic for the entirety of the Championship compromising of interprovincial games, All Ireland Qualifying games and the All Ireland Championship series. The games were also available in Northern Ireland who although able to see Ulster games on BBC Northern Ireland, did not receive the breadth of coverage as available on RTÉ. In 2008, however, TV3 won the rights to show 10 Championship games marking an end to RTÉ's exclusivity. RTÉ though remain the sole broadcaster on radio and retained the All Ireland series exclusively with 40 championship games available on television. Games are also available online at RTÉ.i.e. RTÉ also show highlights of club and National League games on their "Sunday Sport" banner through the winter and spring. In 2011 under a new deal BBC NI show all Ulster Championship matches mostly Live and some deferred shown in full, as well as live coverage of the All Ireland Championship if an Ulster team is playing. Under the 2011 deal TV3 showed 11 matches including both All Ireland minor finals with coverage on TV3 in English and sister channel 3E in Irish. In 2014 a new deal was announced with TV3 losing their coverage to Sky Sports, RTÉ keep their share of the matches but Sky have 14 exclusive matches and other matches such as the All Ireland Semi Finals and Finals which are shared between RTÉ & Sky. Under this deal BBC NI also get to show matches as long as RTÉ also cover them.
The All-Ireland Football Final traditionally attracts high ratings with it too attracting high ratings in previous years.
"RTÉ's championship games are broadcast through their The Sunday Game banner, for more information on their coverage see there"
Among other sports, RTÉ broadcasts the following on television (usually on RTÉ Two):
Sports news bulletins are broadcast hourly on RTÉ 2fm under the title "RTÉ Sport on 2fm".
RTÉ's coverage of rugby remains popular, underlined by the fact that Ireland's Grand Slam decider versus Wales was the overall top rated programme of 2009 with a 68% share of the total audience watching television with 866,000 viewers. The game was also shown on the widely available BBC One, but still ranks above other programmes exclusive to RTÉ.
In 2010 RTÉ bought the rights for Celtic League rugby with TG4, BBC Northern Ireland and BBC Alba. In 2014 Sky Sports signed a non-exclusive deal to cover the Pro 12, under the new contract TG4 continue to show the tournament free to air for Ireland, BBC Wales & S4C continue to cover the tournament in Wales, BBC Scotland return to cover the tournament alongside BBC Alba and BBC Northern Ireland cover all Ulster Matches not being Broadcast by Sky. Under this new deal RTÉ dropped the Pro12 Rugby but continue to show every game in the 6 Nations and all Ireland Autumn Internationals.
RTÉ showed the Heineken Cup for many years and after the coverage was snapped up by Sky Sports in 2004, RTÉ still showed Live coverage until 2007 and then highlights afterwards but in 2011 TG4 took their highlights coverage of the Heineken Cup, Amlin Cup to add to their Pro 12 coverage and Rugby World Cup highlights. As of 2014 RTÉ is the Home of International Rugby holding rights to the 6 Nations and Autumn Internationals signing a deal with Sky Sports to cover Ireland Autumn Internationals.
The Rugby World Cup returned to RTÉ in 2011 after an 8-year gap as the 2007 tournament was on TV3 Ireland. Their coverage was the same as TV3 in the sense they had only 13 live matches with every Irish match Live and every match from the quarter-final onwards with Setanta holding every Live match and TG4 had lucrative daytime deferred rights meaning they can show a full re run of a match in the afternoon. RTÉ also broadcast highlights in primetime between 7pm and 10pm on RTÉ Two. Their Live coverage was presented by Tom McGurk with analysis by Conor O'Shea, Brent Pope and George Hook. Highlights were presented by Daire O'Brien who hosts their Pro 12 coverage with analysis from Victor Costello, Shane Horgan, Frankie Shehan, Leinster coach Joe Schmidt and new signing from ESPN, Ben Kay who won the World Cup in 2003 with England. RTÉ Commentary team consists of Hugh Cahill, Ryle Nugent, Donal Lenihan, Tony Ward, Ralph Keyes and Kurt McQuilkin. George Hamilton was supposed to be part of commentary but he had a heart attack so Darragh Maloney is instead commentating. Any highlights that did not have an RTÉ voiceover instead featured the World Feed, one example was in the highlights show with an England match using Sky Sports Commentators who worked for ITV in 2007, Miles Harrison and Stuart Barnes. RTÉ lost the rights to TV3 for the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England.
RTÉ holds exclusive Irish rights to live coverage of the only professional golf tournament to take place in Ireland, The Irish Open, covering every day's play Live. In 2011 they had play everyday on RTÉ One and Highlights on RTÉ Two late at night. Sky Sports also show all four days of the Irish Open live. RTÉ Radio also cover Saturday and Sunday's action live on Saturday & Sunday Sport.
RTÉ also screen a lot of horse racing, including the Galway Races and Punchestown they have their own coverage for Irish Racing with Treacy Piggott but they take Channel 4 coverage when covering the Grand National, The Derby and the Cheltenham Festival. Sport is shown on RTÉ News.
A programme for the Beijing Olympics was shown on RTÉ Two before the games, called "Ireland's Olympians". RTÉ broadcast most of Ireland's candidates for the gold medal during the Olympiad, as well as the finals in which no Irish took part.
From the 1970s through to 1997, RTÉ's flagship television sports programme was "Sports Stadium", which provided live football and racing coverage on Saturday afternoons along with coverage of other sports and classified football results, in a similar manner to the BBC's "Grandstand" or ITV's "World of Sport". The programme was badly hit by the loss of live rights to Saturday afternoon Football League Division One matches after the beginning of the Premier League in 1992, and ended as part of RTÉ's revamp of Network 2 into N2 in 1997, being replaced for one year by "Saturday Sports Live" (which only concentrated on one single football or rugby game. Since 1998 RTÉ has not covered live sports on Saturday on a weekly basis on television, although major events such as the Six Nations Championship are still shown live.
RTÉ's regular radio sports programming (usually on RTÉ Radio 1) comprises:
Sports news bulletins are broadcast hourly on RTÉ 2fm under the title "RTÉ Sport on 2fm". RTÉ Sport also broadcasts an hour long sports programme "Game On" from 7pm Monday – Friday on 2fm.
When the 2012 RTÉ Sports Person of the Year award was being given to boxer Katie Taylor viewers were instead shown an advertisement for the cosmetics and beauty company L'Oréal, causing uproar. Group head of sport Ryle Nugent commented: "RTÉ sports awards offers sincere apologies for the technical issue at the end of tonight's programme. We're investigating how it happened."

Salmon &amp; Gluckstein

Salmon & Gluckstein were a British tobacconist. Founded in London in 1873 by Samuel Gluckstein and Barnett Salmon (1829-1897), they pursued an aggressive expansion to become the largest tobacco sellers in the UK, with over 140 retail outlets. They claimed however to be the largest tobacconist in the world.
The Gluckstein and Salmon families grew to prominence in the second half of the nineteenth century through their involvement in the tobacco industry.
Beginning as small-time cigar manufacturers, by the turn of the century Salmon and Gluckstein Ltd was the world's largest retail tobacconist, owning 140 retail outlets in 1901. Salmon and Gluckstein Ltd was bought by Imperial Tobacco in 1902 and the brand remained in prominence until 1955.
The business was started in 1855 by Samuel Gluckstein who, having arrived in London in 1841 from Germany, began working in the Jewish tobacco industry. The first business operated from Crown Street, Soho, and by 1864, when the firm was incorporated, Samuel Gluckstein had been joined by Henry Gluckstein and Laurence Abrahams. By that date the business had relocated to 43 Leman Street.
In 1870 a difference of opinion concerning the sharing of the profits resulted in the firm's dissolution. Henry Gluckstein and Laurence Abrahams went on to found Abrahams & Gluckstein, cigar manufacturers of 26 Whitechapel High Street, while Samuel Gluckstein formed a partnership with his two sons Isidore and Montague Gluckstein. They were also joined by Barnett Salmon, a tobacco salesman, who later became Samuel's son-in-law by marrying Helena Gluckstein. In 1873 Samuel Gluckstein died leaving the business to his two sons and Barnett Salmon. In that same year the company Salmon & Gluckstein Ltd. was established. 
In order to avoid future family disputes the three men decided to form a family fund by pooling their resources. The principle of the venture was to encourage the strong to support the weak, with each member withdrawing what was required. As the number of members increased over the years, a more ordered system developed, but essentially this tightly-organised pooling arrangement formed the basis of the bulk of the family's business activities from the late nineteenth century onwards.
Until 1887 these business interests were centred on the firm of Salmon & Gluckstein, tobacco manufacturers and tobacconists. From 1887, however, Montague Gluckstein became interested in the idea of providing catering services for the large exhibitions which were sweeping Victorian Britain. Judging the business of catering to be beneath them, the family only gave their support to Montague on the understanding that the family name would not be used. Accordingly, Montague began searching for a suitable figurehead for his new venture, finding him in Joseph Lyons, a distant family relation. As a result the family company of J. Lyons and Co. was formed.

NetEqualizer

The NetEqualizer is a bandwidth shaping appliance designed for voice and data networks, created by APconnections in 2003. NetEqualizer traffic shaping appliances use built-in behavior-based algorithms to automatically shape traffic during peak periods on the network. When the network is congested, the fairness algorithms favor business class applications at the expense of large file downloads. The favored applications include those such as VoIP, web browsing, web-based applications, chat and email. Traffic is prioritized based on the nature of the traffic, so the NetEqualizer remains Net Neutral.
The NetEqualizer also provides Quality of Service (QoS) through rate limiting, shared limits, and quota. New in 2015 is a DDoS Monitor. In addition, the NetEqualizer can be configured to control both encrypted an unencrypted peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) traffic.
Add-on modules include directory integration (NDI), caching (NCO), and a DDoS Firewall.
The NetEqualizer has been implemented by colleges, universities, libraries, hotels, and businesses around the world. The appliance is currently being used in the rebuilding efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
APconnections is a privately held company founded in 2003 and is based in Lafayette, Colorado.

Tour de Cure

The Tour de Cure is a series of fund-raising cycling events held in forty states nationwide to benefit the American Diabetes Association. The Tour de Cure is a bicycle ride to raise money for diabetes research, and is not an actual race. Each location's ride routes are designed for everyone from the occasional rider to the experienced cyclist.
Over 33,000 riders participated in the 2007 Tour de Cure. In 2008, more than 38,000 cyclists in 78 Tour events raised nearly $16 million to support the mission of the ADA: to prevent and cure diabetes and to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes.
In 2007 the ADA began recognizing those riders with diabetes as Red Riders through the Red Rider Program. This program was created and is organized by Mari Ruddy, a rider in the Colorado Tour de Cure. The program supplies Red Riders with a bright red cycling jersey and a group for individual red riders to join.
Each Tour de Cure event recruits volunteers to help set up and take down start and finish lines and rest stops, mark the routes and print out the guide sheets, assist riders who have run into mechanical difficulties, pick up and transport riders who need to drop out of the event (SAG), keep track of which riders have left and returned, keep riders on route and obeying local cycling laws (Route Marshals) and so on. Since 2015, volunteers with diabetes have been called Red Crew and have been provided with red T-shirts with a variant of the Red Rider/Red Strider logo.
In 2007, the Tour de Cure raised over $13 million for diabetes. In 2008, over $16 million for diabetes was raised in 78 events nationwide. Each ride has various fund-raising minimums, but in 2013, the base value for minimums nationwide was increased from $150 to $200.
Riders of the Tour de Cure may join numerous nationwide and local corporate sponsored teams. National sponsors include:
Greg LeMond, three-time Tour de France winner, is the national spokesperson.

Clyde Engineering

Clyde Engineering was an Australian manufacturer of locomotives, rolling stock, and other industrial products.
It was founded in September 1898 by a syndicate of Sydney businessmen buying the Granville factory of timber merchants Hudson Brothers. The company won contracts for railway rolling stock, a sewerage system, trams and agricultural machinery. In 1907 it won its first contract for steam locomotives for the New South Wales Government Railways. By 1923 it had 2,200 employees. After contracting during the depression it became a major supplier of munitions during World War II.
In 1950 it was awarded the first of many contracts for diesel locomotives by the Commonwealth Railways after it was appointed the Australian licensee for Electro-Motive Diesel products. Apart from building locomotives and rolling stock, Clyde Engineering diversified into telephone and industrial electronic equipment, machine tools, domestic aluminium ware, road making and earth making equipment, hydraulic pumps, product finishing equipment, filtration systems, boilers, power stations and firing equipment, car batteries, hoists and cranes, door and curtain tracks and motor vehicle distribution.
In July 1996 it was taken over by Evans Deakin Industries. In March 2001 Evans Deakin was taken over by Downer Group to form Downer EDi.
Amongst the classes of locomotives built by Clyde Engineering were:
Because of capacity constraints, in the 1990s Clyde leased Australian National Industries' Braemar factory to fulfill its order for FreightCorp 82 class locomotives.

He had her rework the structure to increase its potential in other media becoming "Tempest" with the company hold the film rights. This work was the first deal of MF with Summit Entertainment, who pick up it as a movie in 2010 before the book was published. The movie deal gave the book a higher profile thus increasing its sale upon its January 2012 release enough for a sequel to be in the works for a 2013 release.

Fenton Art Glass Company

The Fenton Art Glass Company was founded in 1905 by brothers Frank L. Fenton and John W. Fenton.
The original factory was in an old glass factory in Martins Ferry, Ohio in 1905. The factory at one time was owned by the old West Virginia Glass Company. At first they painted glass blanks from other glass makers, but started making their own glass when they became unable to buy the materials they needed. They moved across the Ohio river to Williamstown, West Virginia, and built a factory in 1906. The first year for glass production was 1907. In 1908 John Fenton left the company and founded the Millersburg glass company in Millersburg, OH.
Frank Fenton was the designer and decorator. From 1905 to 1920, the designs made there were heavily influenced by two other glass companies: Tiffany and Steuben. But the many different colors were the work of Jacob Rosenthal, a famous glass chemist who is known for developing chocolate and golden agate glass. Towards the end of 1907, the Fenton brothers were the first to introduce carnival glass, which later became a popular collector's item.
During the Great Depression and World War II, Fenton produced practical items (such as mixing bowls and tableware) due to shortages. At the same time, they continued creating new colors. Towards the end of the Great Depression they also produced perfume bottles for the Wrisley Company in 1938. The bottles were made in French opalescent glass with the hobnail pattern.
In 1939, Fenton started selling Hobnail items in milk glass. Hobnail milk glass would become the top-selling line and allowed the Fenton company to expand.
In the late 1940s, the top three members of Fenton's management died. Frank Fenton and Wilmer C. "Bill" Fenton immediately stepped in and took over the positions of President and Vice President, respectively. Over the next thirty years, they continued to expand Fenton Art Glass, despite a large number of glass factories closing down.
In 1986, George W. Fenton, Frank's son, took over as President of the company.
In 1970, the company added their logo to the bottom of their "Original Formula" Carnival Glass pieces to distinguish them from their older Carnival Glass pieces. In 1974, Fenton started putting their logo on all the pieces they made. Pieces made in the 1980s have the number eight under the letter "n" in the logo, pieces from the 1990s have the number nine and pieces made in the 2000s have a 0 in the same place. From June 1996 to July 1998 Fenton marked preferred seconds sold in their gift shop with a sandblasted solid or hollow star. In August 1998 an F replaced the star.
Another type of mark is found on glass baskets. Where the glass handles of the baskets are attached to the base of the basket a stamp is made. Each handler had a specific pattern to help identify which handler attached the handle. The marks began in the 1950s and were instituted by Frank M. and Bill Fenton.
Fenton used a coding system to describe the items it produced. The code used numbers for the pattern and letters for the color. There were also letter codes for any decorations.
Some of the patters used on items produced by Fenton were:
Fenton made hundreds of different colors of glass over the time they were open.
Carnival colors The color of carnival glass is the color of the applied treatment not the color of the piece of glass.
Opalescent colors
Crests This color combination consists of glass of a different color added to the rim of a piece.
Marble or slag A type of glass that is opaque and streaked. It is usually a glass pressed in molds rather than being blown.
Overlay's Overlays are a type of cased glass. Cased glass is made up of different colors in layers.
Vasa Murrhina is a cased glass, the name means vessel of gems. This type of glass has a long history pre dating Fenton. Frank M. Fenton had glass chemist Charles Goe develop a way to make it since the way it was made was long forgotten. The piece starts out as a ball of glass that is rolled in small pieces of broken glass called frit. Then another layer of crystal was gathered over the frit.
Fenton had a long history of decorating glass that goes back to its beginnings in 1905. The Fenton Art Glass company started out as a decorating company that purchased blanks from glass manufacturers and placed their own decorations on them. Fenton did not manufacturer glass until 1907 a year after the Williamstown, WV plant was built.
Decorations found on three or more shapes
On August 9, 2007, Fenton Art Glass sent out a press release stating they would "cease... operations over the next few months."
Their plans involved laying off 25 employees immediately, and in the following weeks, the rest of their workers would be laid off. However, on December 4, 2007, Fenton Art Glass released a press statement, saying that due to an unexpected buying frenzy and internal restructuring, the company would stay open until at least the spring of 2008. In an open letter in August 2008, company president George Fenton said that thanks to the buying frenzy, the company had been able to institute some reforms, and wouldn't be closing in the foreseeable future.
On July 6, 2011, Fenton Art Glass sent out a press release stating they would "wind down production of its collectible and giftware glass products."
According to WTAP TV, "The company cites financial challenges since its restructuring in 2007 and recent developments as factors in its decision to shut down its traditional glassmaking business. Fenton Art Glass says it's exploring the sales of one or more of its product lines."
Fenton ceased "traditional" glassmaking at the Williamstown, WV factory in July 2011. However, the factory remains open as a jewelry making operation, producing handcrafted glass beads and Teardrop earrings. The Fenton Gift Shop, located in the same building, also has a large quantity of glass remaining in their inventory. Visitors to the factory can watch the beadmaking demonstrations and purchase Fenton Art Glass.
In 2015, Fenton’s glass bead jewelry business was purchased by John Barton Company of Philadelphia, PA. Today, the company operates a manufacturing and fulfillment facility in both West Virginia and Philadelphia, producing glass beads for the wholesale and retail markets, as well as selling directly to consumers through a Fenton Glass Jewelry's online store.

S&amp;S Cycle

S&S Cycle is an American motorcycle engine and parts engineer and manufacturer. The company was founded in 1958 by George J. Smith and Stanley Stankos in Blue Island, Illinois. The company started by selling high performance pushrods for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and today they still make parts for a variety of V-Twin bikes. The company's current president is Paul Langley.
Soon after the formation of S&S, George's wife, Marjorie, bought out Stanley Stankos and Smith & Stankos became Smith & Smith. In 1969, the company moved from Blue Island to establish a new headquarters in Viola, Wisconsin. S&S still operates at this location, but opened an additional facility in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 2004.
In July 2007 S&S purchased the Flathead Power (FHP) brand name and intellectual property (trademarks, patents and designs) along with the remaining inventory of parts and tooling and is continuing the vintage brand. The brand was resold in 2014 to the original owner.
In June 2008, the company held its 50th anniversary celebration in La Crosse. Over 28,000 motorcycle enthusiasts attended the celebration, according to the "La Crosse Tribune".
S&S Cycle develops performance replacement engines for v-twin motorcycles, most of which are replacement engines for Harley-Davidson models and are manufactured in the United States. In addition, S&S Cycle developed their own proprietary pushrod v-twin engine, dubbed the X-Wedge that features a 56° cylinder angle instead of the 45° angle used in Harley-Davidson v-twin engines, and which was developed with the custom motorcycle builder (OEM) in mind. The X-Wedge is the basis for the engine from a number of high end motorcycle manufacturers such as Arch Motorcycle and Confederate Motorcycle. The X-Wedge recently found a different kind of application, having been chosen to be the power plant utilized by Morgan Motor company, based out of the United Kingdom, for their development of the Morgan 3 Wheeler cycle car.
S&S was the first motorcycle engine manufacturer to produce pre-certified United States Environmental Protection Agency compliant engines, lifting the burden and cost of performing the complicated EPA testing procedures from the companies and enthusiasts who buy S&S engines. The company also produces TÜV certified engines, and has even succeeded in complying with California's unique emissions requirements. S&S is the only motorcycle company in the world to manufacture Knucklehead, Shovelhead, Panhead, Evolution-style engines and Twin-cam style engines. S&S manufactures the largest (143 cu. in.) engine to fit a stock Harley-Davidson frame.

Champs Sports

Champs Sports is an American sports retail store, it operates as a subsidiary of Foot Locker. Products sold at Champs Sports include apparel, equipment, footwear, and accessories. As of January 2015, there were 547 store locations found throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The stores are mainly located in shopping malls, and are on average.
Champs Sports was acquired in the 1980s by the Woolworth Corporation, then a specialty store division of the F. W. Woolworth Company. It, along with Foot Locker, sold athletic merchandise, replacing the five and dime and department store concepts with the increasing specialty store concept.
In 1997, the Woolworth Corporation acquired the mail-order catalogue athletic retailer Eastbay for approximately 146 million dollars. 
A few months later, on July 17, 1997, the F. W. Woolworth Company closed their remaining department stores. The surviving Woolworth Corporation changed its name to Venator Group, Inc., while continuing its focus on the specialty store idea.
In 2000, after a decline in the market of sports apparel, Venator Group shuttered many of their stores, including 27 Champs Sports locations. This proved successful as high-end footwear grew in popularity.
With the first issue released on August 28, 2012, "Swag" Magazine is a quarterly online magazine focused on showing sports fans a different side of athletes and celebrities. Champs Sports partnered with many companies, including Under Armour, Adidas, and Nike, giving fans an interesting look on sports. The magazine features athlete interviews, athletic gear, and interactive videos.
On September 8, 2012, Champs Sports and Nike launched Nike Yardline, a store specializing in NFL apparel. The first store opened in the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, New Jersey. Champs Sports and Nike stated that they are looking to expand the concept in the future.
Between January 5–6, 2013, a Nike Yardline location was also opened in South Beach, Miami Beach, Florida during BCS weekend. The store displayed college football apparel featuring participating bowl teams, including Alabama Crimson Tide and Notre Dame Fighting Irish.
On June 19, 2013, Champs Sports and Nike launched their second mall-based location in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. Promoting the grand opening was Minnesota Vikings's running back Adrian Peterson, who signed autographs and released a new shoe style.
From 2004 until June 18, 2012, Champs Sports sponsored the Florida Citrus Sports's annual college football bowl game. Each sponsorship is a four-year deal costing them $4.25 million. Vice president of Champs Sports Rob Brodersen commented, "As the premier mall destination for the core sports enthusiast, it is a natural fit for Champs Sports to continue our partnership with FCS. We are excited to strengthen our relationship and look forward to further success by building upon our athletic heritage with this high profile college bowl game." Although the name of the bowl was changed, Champs Sports continued to remain an official partner of both the Russell Athletic Bowl and the Capital One Bowl through 2014.
In late 2002, Nike placed restrictions on stores that sold their products. These restrictions required stores, including Foot Locker and its subsidiaries, to sell less popular lines of merchandise alongside the high-end products. Knowing the sale of these products could negatively impact profits, Foot Locker refused to sell any Nike products unless they received better quality products. Both Nike and Foot Locker suffered from the lack of sales. A negotiated agreement ended the dispute in late 2003, and Nike products were re-admitted to the stores.

Wahoo's Fish Taco

They serve Wahoo fish in their tacos, as well as Mahi-mahi.
Wahoo's was founded in Costa Mesa, California, in 1988 by Chinese-Brazilian brothers Eduardo "Ed" Lee, Renato "Mingo" Lee and Wing Lam, who mixed traditional Chinese and Brazilian flavors with dishes they encountered while traveling in Mexico. Their parents had fled to Brazil in the 1950s following the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War, and settled in São Paulo, opening a Chinese restaurant; their five sons were all born in Brazil. Their father, Cheong Lee, and the eldest brother came to the United States in 1964, and the rest of the family arrived in 1975, opening the Shanghai Pine Gardens restaurant on Balboa Island. Based on their experience working long hours at Shanghai Pine Gardens, the parents insisted that their five children should study medicine, law, or engineering; the eldest brother went to law school, the second brother studied medicine, and the third brother (Wing Lam) attended San Diego State University, initially studying engineering, but switching to finance after being placed on academic probation.
The first Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant, located at 1862 Placentia Avenue in Costa Mesa, opened in November 1989, serving Baja California-style fish tacos. The three brothers (youngest of the five sons) were the main restaurant employees. Wing Lam recounted in 2011 that "back in the day, I took your order, ran to the kitchen, made it and delivered it to your table." The three brothers remain involved in daily operations, with Wing Lam staffing the chain's California-based food truck. The first restaurant was funded in part with US$30,000 the brothers received from their parents after selling Shanghai Pine Gardens.
The Lake Forest location was involved in a November 1995 lawsuit resulting from an incident in which a customer bit into a bloody bandage. The bandage had come off an employee's finger as he was preparing the lettuce, prompting apologies from the owners and changes to food preparation policy, including mandating the use of steel mesh gloves while chopping food and the increased use of food processors.
Steve Karfaridis, the first manager of Wahoo's second location, in Laguna Beach, is now a partner in the business. The corporate headquarters are in Santa Ana, California. The three brothers are still involved with the company, with Wing Lam acting as the public face of the company, working in public relations and marketing. Projected sales in 2004 were . By 2011, annual sales exceeded .
By 1994, Wahoo's had opened two additional locations, one each in Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach. The business permit for the fourth location in Huntington Beach, was delayed over a city code requirement to pay for 12 spaces in the city-owned Main Street parking garage, and an additional location was opened in Lake Forest in May 1994. By late 1995, Wahoo's had six locations in total, five in Orange County, California and one in Denver, Colorado. The Wahoo's that opened in Manhattan Beach in 1998 was the first Wahoo's in California outside Orange County. In 2001, Wahoo's had 22 locations and announced plans to open 40 more by 2006. By 2005, Wahoo's had 36 locations, including the original Costa Mesa restaurant.
Wahoo's has since expanded across California and has opened locations in Colorado, Hawaii, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas. In 2009, Wahoo's announced plans to add 100 franchise locations by 2014, but those plans have slowed. By Wahoo's 25-year anniversary in 2013, they had 64 restaurants in seven states, and would later that year go on to open Wahoo's first international restaurant in Tokyo, Japan.
From the outset, Wahoo's has targeted the surfing community by offering affordable prices and eclectic decor, which uses stickers and surfing equipment inside the restaurant. Wahoo's would cater corporate events for surf apparel companies and local surf contests to build word-of-mouth for its fish tacos. Similar strategies were used to build support in other "extreme" sports communities such as snowboarding, rock climbing, and cycling.
Wahoo's also built a strong youth following by naming a local "athlete of the week" and sponsoring a meal, which would inevitably be attended by the athlete's friends.
The fish tacos served by street vendors in Baja California were, in Lam's recollection, generally filled with unsaleable by-caught fish such as shark; the bycatch would be sold cheaply to street vendors, who sliced the fish into strips, deep fried the strips, and sold the fish in inexpensive tacos with cabbage and tomatoes. While attending San Diego State, Lam came up with the idea to replicate the fish tacos for an American audience, similar to the origin story told by Rubio's founder (and fellow Aztec alumnus) Ralph Rubio. The primary difference was the Wahoo's fish taco was prepared as his family would interpret the recipe: grilled meat, instead of fried, and beans without lard or bacon fat, with vegetarian and vegan options. The brothers' efforts to replicate street tacos with a healthy twist coincided with a renewed consumer interest in "fresh" Mexican cuisine, and Wahoo's has offered nutritional information from the start to cater to health-conscious consumers. In addition, Wahoo's has been credited as creating one of the earliest Asian-taco fusions.
Word-of-mouth from existing stores was sufficient when new Orange County locations were opened, but when Wahoo's expanded north into Manhattan Beach in Los Angeles County, the marketing effort reverted back to advertising in local newspapers and schools.
Wahoo's offer many vegetarian and even vegan options, such as tofu, banzai veggies and brown rice. The restaurant chain also offers a kids' meal menu.
Author Earlene Fowler credits the original Wahoo's location as her office while she was writing her first novel.
January 9, 2013 was proclaimed Wahoo's Fish Taco Day in Costa Mesa to honor the chain's 25th founding anniversary.
Travis Barker, drummer for blink-182, opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California (co-owned with the Lee brothers) in 2004.

Quality Markets

Quality Markets was an American supermarket chain, with stores in Western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. It was a subsidiary of Penn Traffic, but is now a division of Tops Markets LLC.
The first Quality Markets store opened in Jamestown, New York in 1913, and spread into Pennsylvania by the 1930s. They became a subsidiary of Penn Traffic in 1979. They opened their first stores in Buffalo, New York in 1993.
According to their website, they were the first chain store in Western New York to use barcode scanners at the checkout.
After the parent company's third bankruptcy and sale to Tops Markets LLC, Quality stores were converted to Tops by the end of August 2010, along with sister stores P&C and BiLo/Riverside.

Lending Club

Lending Club is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to 31 December 2015. 
Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.
The company raised $1 billion in what became the largest technology IPO of 2014 in the United States. Though viewed as a pioneer in the fintech industry and one of the largest such firms, Lending Club experienced problems in early 2016, with difficulties in attracting investors, a scandal over some of the firm's loans and concerns by the board over CEO Renaud Laplanche's disclosures leading to a large drop in its share price and Laplanche's resignation.
Lending Club was initially launched on Facebook as one of Facebook's first applications. After receiving $10.26 million in a Series A funding round in August 2007, from venture capital investors Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners, Lending Club was developed into a full-scale peer-to-peer lending company.
On April 8, 2008, Lending Club temporarily suspended new lender registration, canceled its affiliate program and entered a "quiet period" while it awaited approval to issue promissory notes to lenders. On June 20, 2008, Lending Club filed an S-1 statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the registration of $600 million in "Member Payment Dependent Notes" to be issued on its Web site. On August 1, 2008, Lending Club filed an amendment to its Form S-1 outlining new interest rate formulas as well as more details on a "resale trading system". On October 14, 2008, Lending Club announced its completion of the SEC registration process, posted the filed prospectus on its website, and resumed new lender registration. Notes issued on or after October 14, 2008 represent Lending Club securities rather than direct obligations of the ultimate borrower and are tradable (can be bought and sold) on the Foliofn trading platform. In March 2009, Lending Club raised $12 million in a Series B funding round led by Morgenthaler Ventures.
In April 2010, the company raised $24.5 million in a Series C funding led by Foundation Capital and joined by existing investors including Morgenthaler Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners. 
In August 2011, Lending Club raised an additional $25 million in venture capital from Union Square Ventures and Thomvest, owned by the Thomson family of Thomson-Reuters. This led to Lending Club earning a $275 million post-money valuation and an increase of $80 million in valuation from the preceding year. Thomson-Reuters founder Peter J. Thomson also invested an unspecified amount of his personal fortune into Lending Club. In fall 2011, Lending Club's headquarters moved to downtown San Francisco; its earlier offices were located in Sunnyvale and Redwood City. Co-founder Soul Htite moved to China to start Dianrong.com, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai.
In 2012, the company employed about 80 people, with Renaud Laplanche continuing as the company CEO and chairman of the Board of Directors. The company averaged about $1.5 million in loan originations daily, with a total of $600 million since its founding. In April 2012, Lending Club's SEC registration from 2008 was renewed for $1 billion USD in Member Payment Dependent Notes and became effective on April 10, 2012. In June 2012, the company received $15 million in new funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and $2.5 million of personal investments from John J. Mack. Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker joined Mack on Lending Club's board of directors. This led to a $570 million valuation of the company. In November 2012, Lending Club surpassed $1 billion in loans issued since inception and announced they were now cash flow positive.
In May 2013, Google Capital purchased a stake in Lending Club. Lending Club also began partnering with smaller banks in order to help streamline their small loans operations. In June 2013 the company partnered with Titan Bank in Texas and Congressional Bank in Maryland in order to help them facilitate loans that would have been otherwise unprofitable for them.
In March 2014, Lending Club began providing loans to small businesses. In April 2014 Lending Club acquired Springstone Financial. In May 2014 Lending Club formed a partnership with Union Bank. On August 27, 2014, Lending Club filed for an IPO with the SEC, the offering taking place in December 2014. On December 10, 2014, the company raised almost $900 million in the largest U.S. tech IPO of 2014. The stock ended the first trading day up 56%, valuing the company at $8.5bn.
Laplanche told Forbes in April 2015 that Lending Club would expand into car loans and mortgages. Lending Club also announced a partnership with Google to extend credit to smaller companies that use Google's business services. The company signed partnerships with Google, Alibaba.com, BancAlliance, and HomeAdvisor, including vetting community bank lenders for BancAlliance (a group of 200 banks), in order to send people on its platform to various community finance institutions. That year Lending Club partnered with Opportunity Fund, announced by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative. The partnership intended to provide $10 million to small businesses in areas of California that are underserved by lenders. Lending Club and other small business lenders partnered with Sam’s Club to deliver its “business lending center” product. In August 2015 the company created Lending Club Open Integration (LCOI). In October, the company launched a multi-draw line of credit product for small businesses.
Like other peer-to-peer lenders including Prosper, Sofi and Khutzpa.com, Lending Club experienced increasing difficulty attracting investors during early 2016. This led the firm to increase the interest rate it charges borrowers on three occasions during the first months of the year. The increase in interest rates and concerns over the impact of the slowing United States economy caused a large drop in Lending Club's share price.
In April 2016 a Lending Club employee reported to Laplanche that the dates on approximately $US 3 million in the firm's loans appeared to have been altered. Lending Club's internal auditor engaged an outside firm to investigate the report. This investigation found additional problems with loans, including that $US 22 million in loans which had been sold to the Jefferies investment bank did not in fact meet the bank's investment criteria. Lending Club bought these loans back from the bank and resold them.
The "New York Times" reported that the investigation found that Laplanche had not disclosed to the board that he owned part of an investment fund which Lending Club was considering purchasing. "The Wall Street Journal" also stated that Laplanche was found to have not fully disclosed what he knew about the problematic loans. 
On 6 May Lending Club's board made it clear to Laplanche that he no longer had their confidence, leading to his resignation on 9 May. "The Wall Street Journal" reported that Laplanche had been fired by the board. Three of the firm's other managers had also been fired or had resigned by that time as a result of the problematic loans. Lending Club's stock price fell by a further 34 percent after Laplanche's departure was announced. This placed the stock price at 70 percent of the price at the time of the firm's initial public offering. As a result of the incident, the Securities and Exchange Commission was reported to be investigating Lending Club's disclosures to investors. From May 2015 until May 2016 the share price of Lending Club had decreased by over 60%. Since Laplanche's announced exit the share price halved again. 
Lending Club enables borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request. All loans are unsecured personal loans and can be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, Lending Club determines whether the borrower is credit worthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period is three years; a five-year period is available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty.
Only investors in 39 US states are eligible to purchase notes on the Lending Club Platform. However, eligibility differs when purchasing notes on the secondary market, FolioFN. Borrowers from all but 2 US states are eligible to apply for a loan.
Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. The loans can only be chosen at the interest rates assigned by Lending Club but investors can decide how much to fund each borrower, with the minimum investment of $25 per note.
Investors make money from interest. Rates vary from 6.03% to 26.06%, depending on the credit grade assigned to the loan. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. The size of the origination fee depends on the credit grade and ranges to be 1.1%-5.0% of the loan amount. The size of the service fee is 1% on all amounts the borrower pays. The company facilitates interest rates that are better for lenders and borrowers than they would receive from most banks. It has averaged between a six and nine percent return to investors between its founding and 2013. However, because lenders are making personal loans to individuals on the site, their gains are taxable as personal income instead of investment income. Therefore, income from Lending Club loans may be taxed at a higher rate than investments that are taxed at the capital gains rate.
After the notes are issued, Lending Club purchases the loans from the issuing bank and notes become the obligations of Lending Club, and not of the ultimate borrower: Lending Club promises to pay the noteholder monies it receives from the borrower less its service fees, while the holders of Lending Club notes have the status of unsecured creditors of Lending Club. This means that there is a risk that the investor may lose all or part of the investment if Lending Club becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy, even if the ultimate borrower continues to pay.
The investors have the ability to put notes up for sale before the notes have reached maturity. This service is offered in a partnership with FOLIOfn Investments which charges a 1% fee on note sales, making Lending Club the first peer-to-peer lending network to offer a secondary market for peer-to-peer loans. Other peer to peer lending networks such as Khutzpa.com have subsequently also partnered with FOLIOfn Investments to offer a secondary market.
As of 2016, a high proportion of funds for Lending Club-facilitated loans came from hedge funds. During May of that year Lending Club was seeking to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans as bonds as part of a strategy to overcome difficulties in accessing sufficient funding.
When initially founded, Lending Club positioned itself as a social networking service and set up opportunities for members to identify group affinities, based on a theory that borrowers would be less likely to default to lenders with whom they had affinities and social relationships. It developed an algorithm called LendingMatch for identifying common relationship factors such as geographic location, educational and professional background, and connectedness within a given social network.
After registering with the SEC, Lending Club stopped presenting itself as a social network and maintaining that social affinity will necessarily reduce the defaulting risk. It now presents the algorithm just as a search tool for investors to find Notes they would like to purchase, using borrower and loan attributes such as the length of a loan term, target weighted average interest rate, borrower credit score, employment tenure, home ownership status, and others. To reduce default risk, Lending Club focuses on high-credit-worthy borrowers, declining approximately 90% of the loan applications it received as of 2012 and assigning higher interest rates to riskier borrowers within its credit criteria. Only borrowers with FICO score of 660 or higher can be approved for loans.
The statistics on Lending Club's website state that, as of 31 December 2015, 68.5 percent of borrowers report using their loans to refinance other loans or pay credit card debt.
As of June 30, 2015, the average Lending Club borrower has a FICO score of 699, 17.7% debt-to-income ratio (excluding mortgage), 16.2 years of credit history, $73,945 of personal income and takes out an average loan of $14,553 that s/he uses for debt consolidation or for paying off credit card debts. The investors had funded $11,217,348,156 in loans, with $1,911,759,192 coming from Q2 2015. The nominal average interest rate is 14.08%, default rate 3.39%, and an average net annualized return (net of defaults and service fees) of 8.93%. The average returns of investment for Lending Club lenders are between 5.47% and 10.22%, with 23 straight quarters of positive returns as of the second quarter of 2013.
In 2011 and 2012 the company was named to as one of the AlwaysOn Global 250. Lending Club is the winner of the World Economic Forum 2012 Technology Pioneer Award. It has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s 20 most promising companies in 2011 and 2012, and by Fast Company as one of the ten most innovative financial companies in the world. It was named one of the Disruptor 50 by CNBC in May 2013 and 2014, as a disruptive innovator in next generation financial services. In 2014, Lending Club was recognized by Inc. as one of the 500 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America at #248. Renaud Laplanche, the company’s founder and CEO, also received The Economist Innovation Award in 2014 for the consumer products category.

Promises Treatment Centers

Promises Treatment Centers is a for-profit provider of residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation with facilities in Malibu, California and West Los Angeles, California. It uses the trademarked "Malibu Model" of treatment, which allows patients more freedom and privatized treatment.
The company was started by Richard Rogg. Elements Behavioral Health now owns Promises. The Company is supported by Frazier Healthcare, a venture capital firm. Promises is not licensed to provide physician or medical services. In 2004, the state of California cited the organization for providing medical services, administering TB tests and having doctors conduct physical exams. Promises stopped the practice as a result. The Company is also known to make significant financial contributions to the campaigns of government officials who oversee their treatment center license.
Elements was sued in the spring of 2016 by United Healthcare for insurance fraud on urinalysis testing. Case 9:16-cv-80649-RLR The case is being heard by a Federal Court in Palm Beach County, Florida. The lawsuit prompted Frazier Healthcare to install its own CEO and terminate the employment of many staff members in Element's upper management. This included some in the HR Department, the VP, and CFO. Since 2013, there have been at least two known drug overdoses while in treatment. One patient died on the premises and the other later at the hospital. 
For its treatment method, Promises uses the term "Malibu Model" which it registered in 2004 as a service mark. The Malibu Model differs from traditional models by allowing patients more liberty and providing privatized treatment, in contrast to regular rehab involving peer groups, never leaving the facility, and limited visitors. The Malibu Model has come under criticism, with some critics claiming the model prioritizes the rehabilitation of public relations rather than addiction treatment.
As of 2014, the fee for a one-month stay is $57,000 which must be paid in advance and is non-refundable if the client leaves or is expelled prior to completion of the stay. According to the "Los Angeles Times", the no-refund policy has prompted a number of lawsuits. These remaining funds may be available to the client should they decide to return to the facility. Promises' clientele has included actress Lindsay Lohan singer Britney Spears, writer and comedian Harris Wittels, musician Ville Valo and musician Marilyn Manson.

Carriers who sold connectivity were charged a monthly recurring fee based on the capacity of the connection. Within three years the company provided interconnection services to every major and most minor telecommunications companies in the United States with the notable exception of Sprint.
More than 800 different carriers, ISPs and businesses participate in LayerOne centers, including the world's largest IP backbone networks.
LayerOne was founded in 1999 by Alexander Muse. By 2001 the company had raised more than $20,000,000 in venture capital and opened facilities in Dallas, Chicago and Miami. While each facility was cash flow positive, the company had executed leases throughout the United States in anticipation of additional funding. When that funding did not materialize Alexander Muse and his management team reorganized the company under the U.S. Bankruptcy code. Within three months the company was profitable and over the next three years the company grew by more than 1000%. In 2005 the company was sold to Switch & Data providing a 600% return for the company's investors.

<doc id="14937349" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14937349" title="Datacube Inc.">
Datacube Inc.

Datacube Inc. (1978–2005) was an image processing company that developed real-time hardware and software products for the industrial, medical, military and scientific markets.
Datacube was founded in the mid-1970s by Stanley Karandanis and J Stewart Dunn. In the early days, Datacube manufactured board level products for the Multibus, which was one of the first computer buses developed for microprocessors. Early boards designed by Dunn were PROM, RAM and character generator boards. Of these, character display boards such as the VT103 and VR107 were the best sellers, and were used in programmable read-only memory (PROM) programmers and similar systems.
Karandanis, Datacube's president and CEO, in his early career followed the leaders in the semiconductor field from Bell Labs through Transitron to Fairchild Semiconductor. Karandanis was director of engineering at Monolithic Memories (MMI) when John Birkner and H.T. Chua designed the first successful programmable logic device, the programmable array logic (PAL) device. His contacts in the semiconductor field were instrumental in providing Datacube with components for its products.
An OEM asked Datacube if a frame grabber could be built on a Multibus board. At the time, a frame grabber was a large box with multiple boards. The VG120 was the first ever commercial single board frame grabber: based on programmable array logic (PAL), it had 320 x 240 x 6 bit resolution, grayscale video input and output.
Karandanis hired Rashid Beg and Robert Wang from Matrox to develop the first Q-Bus (DEC LSI-11) frame grabber. They developed the QVG/QAF120 dual board, 8-bit product primarily for a new startup named Cognex. While the latter were developing the hardware for Datacube, they were also planning to spin off and form a competitor, Imaging Technology, which was later purchased by Dalsa.
To recover from this loss, and to complete the QVG120 product, Dave Erickson was hired as a consultant in 1981 from Octek, by the engineering manager Paul Bloom. Dave came on full-time in 1982, as did Dave Simmons who was to head applications, and Bob Berger, who was to head software. At this time, Imaging Technology Inc. (ITI) was developing a line of frame grabber products for Multibus and Q-bus, with a 'real time' image processor based on a single point multiplier, adder and lookup table (LUT). In 1983, Karandanis hired Shep Siegel from Ampex, who had worked on the advanced and successful Ampex Digital Optics (ADO) real-time video spatial manipulator for the broadcast TV market.
With Dunn's help, Simmons developed the VG123 Multibus and Q-bus frame grabber boards. During this development, Paul Bloom was killed in what was apparently a gangland style murder. The mystery of why this happened has never been solved. Dave Erickson was promoted to engineering manager to replace Bloom.
Siegel came to add the SP123 image processor to the '123 family. But having worked on ADO, Siegel saw the limitations of the single-point architecture, and had a vision of what could be done by applying pipelined real-time imaging. He came with an understanding of digital signal processor devices (DSPs), image processing, filtering, and 2D warping, and with programmable logic in hand, saw what could be done.
Erickson and Dunn had developed frame grabber boards deployed on most standard busses. Each potential new customer required features not currently available, and designing, laying out (using hand taped artwork) and manufacturing a board for a single customer was risky, slow and expensive. What was needed was a way to leverage the technology developed so that it could be applied to a wider customer base. Erickson felt that a modular architecture where functions could be easily added and a system tailored to a customers needs was critical.
At this time, the VME bus was being introduced by Motorola for their Motorola 68000 processors. The automotive and military markets liked the VMEbus because it was open and rugged. Datacube developers embarked on a marketing road trip to visit potential customers in the medical, automotive and military markets to inquire what imaging functions they needed.
A Modular and expandable system based on the VMEbus form factor could meet many customer needs. MaxVideo and the MaxBus were born. Marketing research determined the primary functions required and a road map for the next few years. The first seven MaxVideo boards were Digimax (digitizer and display), Framestore (triple 512^2 framestore with unprecedented density), VFIR (first real-time 3x3 image filter, SNAP (3x3 Systolic Neighborhood Array Processor), Featuremax (real-time statistics) SP (single point general purpose processor) and Protomax (MaxVideo prototyping board). 10 beta customers were lined up to receive the first 7 boards. MaxWare was the software and drivers written to control the new boards.
The first demo of the new hardware consisted of a camera's output being processed in real time by VFIR and displayed on a monitor. Siegel wrote a loop that varied the VFIR coefficients on a frame-by-frame basis to demonstrate not only the video real-time functionality, but that the function could be easily changed. In the spring of 1985, the product was not production-ready, so private viewings were set up with potential customers at the Detroit Vision '85 show. Customers' reaction was positive and three months later the first shipments to customers went out.
MaxBus was based on the '123's expansion bus. It required accurate synchronization: clocking and timing of each board plus a flexible way to route data from function to function. A simple differential ECL bus with a driver on one end and terminator on the opposite end was used. For data, 14 pin ribbon cables allowed 8-bit 10 MHz data to be routed from any output to any input.
At this time the company started to grow. Barry Egan was brought on to head manufacturing, entrepreneur Barry Ungar was brought on as President. Bob Berger expanded the software department, and moved the main computers from CP/M machines to Unix machines based on LSI-11s from Digital Equipment Corporation. A Unix based Pyramid mainframe computer was purchased for hardware and software development. Berger bought the first Sun workstations and set up an Ethernet LAN. He registered "datacube.com" as the 68th internet domain name in existence (now owned by Brad Mugford). In hardware, John Bloomfield was hired from Ampex.
The second tier of MaxVideo products was developed. Siegel began the first image warper consisting of Addgen, Interp, and XFS. John Bloomfield expanded the fixed 512 x 512 processing to include Regions-of-interest (ROI) processing. He began developing with the new FPGAs from Xilinx. RoiStore, MaxScan (first arbitrary sensor interface), VFIR-II and MaxSigma. These products established Datacube as the technology leader in real-time imaging.
It was clear that a better way than the low-level control of MaxScan was needed to manage complex new imaging pipelines. ImageFlow was developed. It provided full pipeline delay management and optimization, and a consistent API for programming imaging hardware. Key software programmers were brought on: Ken Woodland, Stephen Watkins and Ari Berman.
Recognizing that not every imaging function could be best done in a pipeline, Siegel teamed with Analog Devices new digital signal processor (DSP) group to develop Euclid, based on the ADSP-2100. Color digitization was required for some markets, so Siegel teamed with broadcast consultant Robert Bleidt to develop Digicolor.
Datacube's first generation image warper caught the attention of the 'image exploitation' industry and in particular, Lockheed. Later, Siegel developed the second generation warper for ROIs: Addgen MkII, based on the Weitek 3132, and Interp MkII. Dunn developed Megastore to handle the large images that this market required. By now the original SP and Featuremax were running out of steam so SP MKII and FeaturemaxMkII were developed. Erickson developed MaxMux, the first Datacube board to use a custom ASIC. The MaxMux ASIC was also used on ROIStore to route signals.
To address the need to combine imaging and workstation graphics, Dunn and Erickson developed MaxView, a high resolution display with the ability to perform real time image display in a window. Watkins ported X Window to this display. Despite the fact that a single box of maxVideo hardware could replace a room full of hardware at Lockheed, the product was not bought. Lockheed made too much money on the legacy system to want to update to the newer, smaller, better system.
A typical system now consisted of a MaxBox 20 slot VMEbus chassis with up to 20 boards installed. The largest MaxVideo system ever built was by Honeywell for aerial target identification. It consisted of five 20 slot chassis full of MaxVideo Hardware. A new MaxBus repeater was developed for these very large systems. Another important design-in for MaxVideo 10 was the FLIR pod test system built by Martin Marietta. Sandia National Labs adopted MaxVideo for a Radar image targeting system.
The next step was to implement up to a full rack of MaxVideo 10 hardware in a dual slot VMEbus package, increase the pipeline to 20 MHz, maintain the modularity and flexibility, and eliminate most of the blue MaxBus cables. MaxVideo 20 was born. This required a new 3-port image memory module base on the 72 pin SIMM form factor and was developed by Dunn. Up to 6 memories were used on each Max20. Max20 also leveraged a new line of Imaging chips from LSI Corporation, including a 32 x 32 digital crosspoint and an 8x8 20 MHz finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Dunn developed a new display controller, AG capable of up to 40 MHz display, and Erickson developed a new family of 20 MHz analog and flexible digital front ends, AS and AD. Dunn developed the color digitizer, AC. Another feature of MaxVideo20 was the new general processing ASIC, AU developed by Dunn. This device contained many innovative linear, nonlinear and statistical imaging functions. Its architecture was to be the core of not only Max20 but the next generation imaging system as well. Built in the pre-RTL age of schematics, Dunn's AU ASIC incorporated booth multipliers designed by mathematician Steve Gabriel.
The memory SIMM was implemented with CPLDs, FPGAs and Graphics DRAM. It was limited to 1MB of memory and required 14 devices tightly packed onto the SIMM. Siegel developed VSIM, a fast and powerful ASIC to control high density SDRAMS and built a 3 device replacement SIMM. It was a triple ported image memory capable of 1, 4 or 16MB memory sizes, up to 40MB/s input and output bandwidths, and contained numerous image processing functions as well. VSIM technology was to be used on numerous future products.
A number of MaxModule processing modules were developed for MaxVideo 20. One of these was Siegel's MiniWarper, a 20 MHz real-time warper based on a new ASIC design, MW4242. With the advent of MaxModules, it was now possible to implement an imaging function on a small and simple board with much less overhead than a full VME board.
IBM military division in Gaithersburg MD was interested in a new image exploitation system, and so Datacube developed a third generation exploitation system for them. This powerful system used an extremely high bandwidth image memory and an address generator by Erich Whitney, capable of 7x7 spatial transformation matrices, all calculated with double precision floats. A powerful new display system, XI was developed to display the results.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of a firm contract, IBM took only a couple of these systems and one year of Datacube's talented engineering efforts were effectively wasted. But Datacube had other projects going. It leveraged several key technologies with MaxVideo 20. An off-the-shelf disk storage system was integrated to be used for medical and image exploitation systems, but this system had unsolvable technical problems, so Siegel developed MD, based on an off-the-shelf external SCSI RAID box. A 12 bit digitizer, Digi-12 was developed by Erickson and was a key element in the Picker Digital Radiology system. Datacube designed an interface to a Sky array processor to obtain a GE military contract for a submarine sonar system.
Until 1996, MaxVideo has been entirely VMEbus based. VMEbus, Unix, OS-9, VxWorks and Lynx-OS had served markets well, but Windows 95 and Pentium-based personal computers (PCs) with PCI bus were coming on strong. Clearly a PC version of MaxVideo was required. MaxPCI was developed over 2 years. VSIM was already capable of MAX PCI's target processing speed of 40 MHz, but everything else needed to be updated or redesigned. The core of MaxPCI was a new, giant crosspoint ASIC: 50 x 40 x 8 with full ROI timing crosspoint and many imaging functions as well, developed by Whitney. Dunn redesigned the AU ASIC to operate at 40 MHz, and a new statistics unit was developed. Tim Ganley developed the acquisition subsystem and Simmons developed a new family of 40 MHz analog and digital front-ends, QA and QD.
For an integrated display, a VGA board from another imaging company, Univision was used. For a real-time disc solution, Shep developed NTD, a software solution for real-time disc access.
Meanwhile, Datacube recognized the need to better help its customers develop complex solutions in the medical, web inspection and machine vision markets. So three vertical integration development groups were formed. Siegel headed Medical, Simmons headed Web, and Scott Roth headed Machine vision. Each of these groups developed systems for OEMs in their respective markets.
Karandanis' contacts in the semiconductor market gave Datacube a competitive edge in applying new technologies. In the early days, Video digital-to-analog converters (DACs) were large modules or expensive and power hungry bipolar devices. Datacube worked with Silicon Valley startup Telmos to develop the first integrated Video DAC. This was used on the '128 family as well as Digimax. It was the starting point for all Video DACs and RAMDACs by Brooktree and others. Datacube was to ride several technological waves including fast ADCs, disk drives, DRAM, DSP devices and custom ASICs.
Programmable logic was the key to Datacube's functional density: from the early days of bipolar programmable array logic (PAL) and programmable read-only memory (PROM) to generic array logic (GAL), to every generation of FPGAs from Xilinx and then Actel and Quick Logic, and Altera CPLDs. Many semiconductor manufacturers acknowledged that Datacube could help bring their new products to market. Datacube was an ideal beta site and they shared their roadmaps, latest offerings, and support.
ASICs were critical to Datacube's success. From the first small crosspoint: 3000 gates in 2 micrometres, AU: 40,000 gates in 0.8 micrometre, through VSIM, MiniWarper, AU40 and IXP. Each of these devices were leveraged across several products. After IXP the density and cost of FPGAs began to catch up to full ASICs and so FPGAs were the technologies of choice.
Datacube was always a hardware-centric company. Its products competed against software solutions running on CPUs. When CPUs were in the 100-1000MIPS range, Datacube's 1G-10G solutions were very appealing. When CPUs and multi-core CPUs began to exceed 1000 MIPS, Datacube solutions were no longer needed, except for the very highest end applications. And the profits on these applications were not adequate to sustain a business.
Datacube managers always had the attitude that the best way to protect intellectual property (IP) was to stay ahead of competition, and felt that patents were a waste of time and money, attracting competition and potential infringement suits. So despite the many inventions, firsts and ideas developed, there were few patents filed. This lack of patents ultimately left no base of technology to licensing opportunities.

International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation

The International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation is an international conference organised by the European Language Resources Association every other year (on even years) with the support of institutions and organisations involved in Natural language processing. The series of LREC conferences was launched in Granada in 1998.
Forthcoming conference:
Past conferences:
The survey of the LREC conferences over the period 1998-2013 has been presented during the 2014 conference in Reykjavik as a closing session. It appears that the number of papers and signatures is increasing over time. The average number of authors per paper is highier too. The percentage of new authors is between 68% and 78%. The distribution between male (65%) and female (35%) authors is stable over time. The most frequent technical term is "annotation", then comes "part-of-speech".
The LRE Map was introduced at LREC 2010 and is now a regular feature of the LREC submission process for both the conference papers and the workshop papers. At the submission stage, the authors are asked to provide some basic information about all the resources (in a broad sense, i.e. including tools, standards and evaluation packages), either used or created, described in their papers. All these descriptors are then gathered in a global matrix called the LRE Map. This feature has been extended to several other conferences.

Sheppard Robson

Sheppard Robson (previously "Richard Sheppard, Robson & Partners" ) is a British architecture firm, founded in 1938 by Sir Richard Herbert Sheppard, with offices in London, Manchester, Glasgow, and Abu Dhabi. It was particularly influential in the 1950s-1960s, pioneering the use of concrete shell structures, and in the present day as a leader in sustainable architecture, building the UK's first net zero carbon house in 2007 as well as designing the LEED Platinum Siemens Middle East Headquarters at Masdar City, which completed in 2014. The latter project was cited as exemplifying “a new generation [that] has emerged [at the practice], which is balancing performance, especially of the sustainable variety, with form” . The practice has offices in London, Manchester, Glasgow and Abu Dhabi and in the 2000s established an award-winning interior design group, ID:SR Sheppard Robson.
Sheppard Robson was founded in 1938 by Richard Sheppard, (later knighted for his work in architecture), a technically skilled designer with a talent for developing new materials, who was disabled as a teenager by polio, and Jean Shufflebottom, his wife, a gifted architect in her own right. The company’s first big success was the Jicwood Bungalow in 1944, which used materials from aircraft manufacture.
By 1950 the company had built a reputation for large modern projects, and Richard Sheppard had a new business partner, Geoffrey Robson, who added his name to the company’s. At first they specialized in schools, building more than 80 in the 1950s. In 1958 the company won a competition to design a science college and memorial to Winston Churchill - Churchill College, Cambridge. Later they branched out into other public buildings, and by the 1970s they had built a strong reputation in commercial and retail buildings.
In the 1990s and 2000s the Practice entered a period of growth with innovative, often large-scale buildings like The Helicon, Toyota/Lexus HQ, MediaCityUK, the Lighthouse, Barking Riverside and Siemens HQ Middle East. Many of these were important landmarks in the development of sustainable architecture. For instance, the Lighthouse was the UK’s first net zero carbon house, the Helicon was an early sustainable office/retail building, and MediaCityUK was built as a sustainable community, verified by international sustainability regulator BREEAM (the first corporate building to achieve this).
The Practice's recently completed and ongoing projects include the transformation of an urban block in London's Fitzrovia (Fitzroy Place), the completion of a new science building at the University of Hertfordshire, and the creation of new residential-led neighbourhoods of 1500 homes at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (East Wick and Sweetwater).
Sheppard Robson is known for sustainable architecture, which it helped to pioneer in the early 1990s with buildings like the Helicon and the Lighthouse, which was the UK’s first net zero-carbon house. Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts, completed in 2010, was the first college or university to win a BREEAM Outstanding rating for sustainability. The Helicon was an early sustainable office/shop building, and MediaCityUK was built as a sustainable community, verified by the international sustainability regulator BREEAM (the first corporate building to achieve this).
Sheppard Robson has four offices in London, Manchester, Glasgow and Abu Dhabi, and about three hundred and fifty employees, mostly architects. Sheppard Robson Architects LLP trading as Sheppard Robson became a Limited Liability Partnership in 2014, also incorporating Sheppard Robson Limited and Sheppard Robson International as limited companies, all is run its nineteen partners. At the moment, Sheppard Robson is the fourth biggest architectural practice in the UK.
Sheppard Robson has an interior design group, ID:SR, the largest integrated interior design group within a UK architecture practice, which has produced work for BBC North, Channel 4 and London Borough of Newham.
Although Sheppard Robson is best known for its modern looking high-impact buildings, the company headquarters is a refurbished piano factory hidden in a courtyard in Camden Town, London.

Its owner is Ocean Capital Investments, New Brunswick Limited. The focus is providing local radio for the communities it serves, live-to-air streaming on the internet, and podcasts. Acadia Broadcasting operates four radio stations in New Brunswick and two in Nova Scotia under the Acadia Broadcasting name. In 2007, Acadia Broadcasting acquired Fawcett Broadcasting with its three northwestern Ontario radio stations. In January 2010, Acadia acquired two more stations in Thunder Bay, ON. In March 2014, Acadia acquired another station in Moncton, NB. In April 2016, Acadia has acquired another radio station in Yarmouth NS.
In 1928, CFBO was launched by C.A. Monro Limited. Mr. Monro had obtained a private commercial broadcasting license from the Department of Marine and Fisheries of the Dominion of Canada in Ottawa, dated April 1, 1928, for the purpose of setting up and operating an AM radio station of only 50 watts in Saint John, New Brunswick. This was radio license No. 23 issued in Canada.
In 1934, four Saint John, New Brunswick newspaper-publishing shareholders - Howard P. Robinson, J.D. McKenna, T.F. Drummie and L.W. Bewick - purchased the station CFBO from C.A. Monro. Overnight, the station's new call letters became CHSJ, and it broadcast out of a new modern studio with new experienced management. Operated by Saint John Publishing Co. Limited, CHSJ soon became an affiliate of CBC Radio's Trans-Canada Network, an important link in the development of the national network.
In 1944, Kenneth C. Irving purchased Saint John Publishing Company Limited from its principal shareholder, Howard P. Robinson. With this purchase, Irving acquired both the CHSJ radio station and the two local newspapers. Later that year, the company name was changed to New Brunswick Publishing Company Limited and its subsidiary New Brunswick Broadcasting was responsible for CHSJ radio.
In 1989, New Brunswick Broadcasting purchased Acadia Broadcasting, CKBW in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia from the retiring shareholders. The new ownership kept the station name, Acadia Broadcasting.
In 2001, New Brunswick Broadcasting launched two new radio stations in New Brunswick, CHWV-FM in Saint John, NB and CHTD-FM in St. Stephen, NB.

Sevmash

JSC PO Sevmash () is a shipbuilding company based in Severodvinsk, a port city on Russia's White Sea. The name Sevmash is an abbreviation of "Severnoye Mashinostroitelnoye Predpriyatie" (Северное Машиностроительное Предприятие), i.e. "Northern Machine-Building Enterprise". Sevmash is the largest shipbuilding enterprise in Russia and today the country's only nuclear submarine producer. In 2009, the company employed 26,951 people and its revenue from military production was $533.02 million.
The shipyard's main specialization is manufacturing of ships, submarines and military equipment for the Russian Navy. Sevmash is the only shipyard in Russia producing nuclear submarines. The next to last nuclear submarine produced at the shipyard is the nuclear-powered attack submarine "Severodvinsk", which was launched in 2010 and is currently fitting out. Its completion had been delayed due to financial issues. The second Borei class submarine "Aleksandr Nevskiy" was launched later in 2010 and delivered to the Navy on 23 December 2013, becoming the 130th nuclear-powered submarine delivered by Sevmash. There is one other "Kazan" and one Borei class submarine "Vladimir Monomakh" currently under construction at the shipyard. In 2003—2005, Sevmash delivered two Project 636 (Kilo class) diesel-electric submarines to foreign customers. As of 2009, the company had an order for a further two Project 636 vessels.
Under a contract for Rosoboronexport, Sevmash conducted repair and modification work on the former Soviet heavy aircraft carrying cruiser "Admiral Gorshkov", transforming it into a modern aircraft carrier named "INS Vikramaditya" for the Indian Navy. The project had been hit by delays and increasing costs, and was finally completed in November 2013.
An increasingly important product line for the shipyard is production for oil and gas fields projects on the Arctic shelf, including oil platforms. The "Prirazlomnaya" ice-resistant stationary platform designed by the Rubin Marine Equipment Design Bureau and built at the shipyard is the first of its kind in Russia. It is due to start operations in the Pechora Sea. Sevmash has also delivered platforms for foreign companies, such as the marine semi-submerged "MOSS CS-50" platform for the Norwegian Moss Mosvold Platforms AS company, which was finished in February 2006. Sevmash has received orders for 3 further platforms of this type. Sevmash is also building a platform for the mid-Barents Sea Shtokman gas field.
The enterprise is also engaged in commercial shipbuilding, and has during the last decade built over 100 vessels, including sea and harbor tugs, mini-bulkers, pontoons, barges and fish farms. It also produces metallurgical equipment and rail transportation items.
Sevmash has a work force of 26,951 people. Based in the city of Severodvinsk in Arkhangelsk Oblast on the White Sea, its facilities occupy an area of more than 300 hectares and it has more than 100 subdivisions. It is the largest shipbuilding enterprise in Russia. Since August, 2007, Sevmash has been headed by Nikolai Yakovlevich Kalistratov.
The company's revenue from military production in 2009 was estimated to be $533.02 million, up from $431.04 million in 2008. Civilian production amounted to 20% of the company's total revenue, and export share of total production was 10%, according to figures published by Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies. The centre ranked Sevmash as the 7th most successful enterprise of the Russian defense industry in 2009, based on a comparison of key financial and operational indicators.
The construction of the enterprise had its origins in the first 5-year plan when the decision was made to significantly expand shipbuilding capacity. The building of what became SEVMASH began in 1936. The shipyard was developed in accordance with resolution of the Council of Labour and Defence under the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR on May 31, 1936 №137-OK for the construction and repair of large warships of different classes. as part of Stalin's industrialization program and a forced labor camp, part of gulag archipelago, was responsible for the initial construction of its facilities along the left bank of the Nikolskiy Estuary at the mouth of the Severnaya Dvina River. The official establishment date is 21 December 1939, when the hull of its first ship, the battleship "Sovetskaya Belorussiya" was laid down. The enterprise was known in Soviet times as "Shipyard Number 402 ()." During World War II, the shipyard was involved in repairing warships and producing turret artillery units and mine-sweeping equipment. Also during the war years the enterprise built large mine hunters, destroyers, diesel-electric submarines, ferries, lighters, floating repair barges, while repairing both Northern Fleet surface ships as well as vessels delivering supplies via the Arctic Convoys. By 1950 the shipyard had repaired 139 ships and vessels. In the early 1950s, large-scale production of submarines was launched. In 1969, the company produced world's first nuclear submarine with a titanium alloy hull, Project 661. In the mid-1970s, its facilities underwent major reconstruction; its industrial capacity was doubled and it had Russia's largest covered slipway installed. The Typhoon class nuclear submarine cruiser Project 941, built in 1981, entered the Guinness World Records as the world's biggest submarine. During its history as of 2009, the company had built 45 surface ships and 163 submarines, including 128 nuclear submarines.

Golden Fleece Company

Golden Fleece was a brand of petroleum products and service stations operated by H.C. Sleigh and Company. A partnership was founded in Melbourne, Australia in 1893 by shipowner and merchant Harold Crofton Sleigh (1867–1933) and manufacturer and shipowner John McIlwraith (1828–1902). In 1913 the company took delivery of its first consignment of motor spirit from the United States and marketed it in Australia as "Golden Fleece".
Initially, motor spirit was sold in drums only—the first Golden Fleece pump being installed in 1920. Golden Fleece was a pioneer of single-branded service stations (as opposed to the more common multi-brand offerings of the era), and its distinctive "golden merino" trademark was soon a common sight for Australian motorists.
The post-war era saw a massive expansion of Australia's motor industry and car ownership soared. The company was made public in 1947. These were boom times for Golden Fleece and expansion and acquisitions were the trend throughout the 1950s and 1960s. H.C. Sleigh Limited acquired the fledgling "Kangaroo" and "Phillips 66" brands in 1962 and 1967 respectively. During these years, many (if not most) Golden Fleece service stations became roadhouse-style outlets with restaurants and bold signage.
Some time during the 60-70's Golden Fleece gained a major contract by the, then small, major trucking company Linfox, that is still held by Caltex today, due to a friendship between Regional Manager for Victoria Max Collins and Lindsay Fox.
The company never had its own oil refinery and depended on Caltex to facilitate the importation and refining of crude oils at Kurnell in Sydney on its behalf. In the late 1970s the industry started to mature and rationalise due to soaring crude oil prices, and Federal Government oversight of petrol and diesel prices which was a subtle form of price control. Inevitably Golden Fleece was itself acquired by Caltex in 1981 and no longer trades under that name, though its unique livery can still be seen on some older roadhouses in rural Australia. A particular treasure for collectors are the globes (in the shape of the Golden Fleece ram) that sat atop the company's pumps until the 1970s, when the pumps were standardised.
Purr Pull was a brand marketed by Independent Oil Industries of Sydney they also sold Purr Star and Resis Oil. The company was brought out by Smith Wylie (Aust) Pty Ltd in Queensland who ran the company as Purr Pull Industries and then in 1954 H.C. Sleigh took over Purr Pull Industries Pty Ltd. dropping the Purr Pull and Star brands and selling it as Golden Fleece.

Kaltura

Kaltura is a New York-based software company founded in 2006. Kaltura states that its mission is to power any video experience. Kaltura operates in four major markets for video based solutions: Cloud TV (AKA OTT TV) for operators and media companies, OVP (Online Video Platform) offered mostly to media companies and brands looking to distribute content or monetize it, EdVP (Education Video Platform) offered to educational institutions who are increasingly relying on video as for teaching and learning, and EVP (Enterprise Video Platform) offered to enterprises who use video for collaboration, communications and marketing. Kaltura offers a broad Video Platform as a Service, as well as turnkey video based SaaS solutions across all these markets. 
Kaltura is the initiator and backer of a successful open-source video-management project.
Kaltura's original concept was built on the collaborative Wiki model that uses media rather than text. Over time, the company changed its focus to providing a broad video platform as a service, as well as many turnkey SaaS products. The vision of Kaltura has been that video is everywhere, and as a new data type, needs to be treated at the platform level. 
Kaltura was founded in the fall of 2006 and was launched at the TechCrunch40 industry event in San Francisco on September 18, 2007, and won the People's Choice award based on a vote of the conference's attendees. At that time, the company had 20 employees, and had received $2.1 million in funding from business angels and Californian VC fund Avalon Ventures.
On December 21, 2007, Kaltura won the People's Choice award (over 250,000 users participated in voting) in the Video Sharing category for the Mashable Open Web Awards. Also in 2007, Kaltura began a partnership with the New York Public Library, whose team was headed by Joshua Greenberg. In 2008, Kaltura was selected as one of the "Global 250 Winners" by AlwaysOn. Kaltura CEO and cofounder Ron Yekutiel was photographed for the article "The Suit, Vers. 3.0" in "Esquire"'s July 2008 edition.
In January 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation and Kaltura announced that they had begun a collaboration aimed at bringing rich-media collaboration to Wikipedia and other wiki websites. The technology behind this project is a form of video-wiki software (open source and still in beta) that is integrated into the MediaWiki platform as an extension, allowing users to add collaborative video players that enable all users to add and edit images, sounds, diagrams, animations and movies in the same manner as they do today with text.
Kaltura was a sponsor of the Wikimania 2008 event, where it announced that it is sponsoring Michael Dale, an open source video developer, to support the further development of a 100% open source video editing solution integrated into MediaWiki. Kaltura is also a founder of the Open Video Alliance, a group of organizations, academics, artists and entrepreneurs, geared towards promoting open standards for video on the web.
In May 2014 Kaltura purchased Tvinci for its over-the-top (OTT) TV service.
In August 2016, Kaltura announced that it had raised $50 million from Goldman Sachs.
Kaltura currently has offices in US, Israel, United Kingdom, and Brazil.

Bianchi Bicycles

F.I.V. Edoardo Bianchi S.p.A, commonly known as Bianchi () is the world's oldest bicycle-making company still in existence, having pioneered the use of equal-sized wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The company was founded in Italy in 1885 and in addition to bicycles it produced motorcycles from 1897 to 1967. In 1955 the joint-venture Autobianchi was created together with Fiat and Pirelli for the manufacturing of cars – Autobianchi was subsequently sold to Fiat in 1969.
Throughout its modern era, Bianchi has been associated with the Italian Giro d'Italia and Tour de France winners, Fausto Coppi, Marco Pantani and Felice Gimondi.
Edoardo Bianchi, a 21-year-old medical instrument maker, started his bicycle-manufacturing business in a small shop at 7 Via Nirone, Milan in 1885. Bianchi pioneered the front-wheel caliper brake. Since May 1997, the company has been part of 
Cycleurope Group, which is owned by the Swedish company of Grimaldi Industri AB.
The Bianchi reputation began when the company sponsored Giovanni Tommasello, the winner of the Grand Prix de Paris sprint competition in 1899. Fifteen years later it was making 45,000 bicycles, 1,500 motorcycles and 1,000 cars a year. In 1935 Bianchi sponsored Costante Girardengo, one of the first Italian stars on the road, and its bicycle sales rose to 70,000 a year. In 1950 Fausto Coppi won the Paris–Roubaix on a Bianchi equipped with what was later named the Campagnolo Paris–Roubaix derailleur gear, for which Bianchi bicycles featured the necessary special drop-outs until 1954. He won the race by two and a half minutes on a bicycle equipped with Universal brakes, Bianchi steel handlebars and stem, a Regina chain and a four-speed freewheel with shaped teeth. It also had Nisi rims, Campagnolo hubs and Pirelli tyres. It was made for sale only in 57 and 59 cm, smaller than the bike that Coppi used. A variation known as the Campione Del Mondo followed Coppi's win in the 1953 world championship.
Riders of different eras have been associated with Bianchi including Felice Gimondi, who continues his association with the company. Recent riders include Danilo Di Luca, Mario Cipollini, Gianni Bugno, Laurent Fignon, Marco Pantani, Moreno Argentin and Jan Ullrich. Until 2007, Bianchi was a cosponsor of the UCI ProTour team, Liquigas. It did not supply teams from 1959 to 1964 nor from 1967 to 1972. In October 2011, for the 2012 season, it was announced that Bianchi had been signed to a two-year deal to co-sponsor and supply bikes to the UCI ProTeams Vacansoleil-DCM and Androni Giocattoli-Venezuela. These sponsorships continued in 2013 and for 2014, with Vacansoleil-DCM ceasing to exist, Bianchi again supplied Androni Giocattoli-Venezuela for a further year, and the then new Belkin Pro Cycling Team. In 2015, the latter became Team LottoNL-Jumbo and Bianchi's only UCI Pro Continental sponsored road team.
The most demanding rider may have been Pantani. Sara Mercante, head of Bianchi's research and development, said: "Pantani had very specific ideas about what he wanted. He had 30 different frames a year from us—with different angles and weights on each one. He changed his bike after every ride. I'd go and meet him during the Giro d'Italia and the Tour and discuss improvements with him. He'd ask to have the geometry changed by, say, half a degree, just to make sure the bike was absolutely perfect. He'd want different angles for different races. He's ask us to tweak the length of the top tube by a millimetre or by half a degree. Pantani was quite obsessive."
Bianchi is currently headed up by CEO Bob Ippolito, who before joining Bianchi was the Executive Vice President and General Manager of Pacific Cycle, headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin.
Bianchi bicycles are traditionally painted Celeste (pronounced "che-les-te" in Italian, "Se-lest" in English), a turquoise also known as Bianchi Green, (and sometimes, incorrectly Tiffany Blue, a trademarked colour). Contradictory myths say Celeste is the colour of the Milan sky, the eye colour of a former queen of Italy for whom Edoardo Bianchi made a bicycle (the crowned eagle of the company logo is an adaptation of the former royal crest) and that it was a mixture of surplus military paint. The shade has changed over the years, sometimes more blue, then more green.
Bianchi USA is the United States division of Bianchi based in Hayward, California. It oversees the production of bicycles built in Taiwan and in Italy for the worldwide market.
Bianchi also took part in motorcycle races, where one of its first riders was Tazio Nuvolari, whom Ferdinand Porsche called "the greatest driver of the past, the present, and the future."
The company began making trucks in the 1930s and supplied the Italian army during World War II . It was that that brought the end of production shortly after peace returned because the factory had been so heavily bombed.
Bianchi continued with motorcycles, particularly the 125cc Bianchina and the Aquilotto, an auxiliary motor for a conventional bicycles. Bianchi took on Lino Tonti as its research engineer in 1959. It produced 250, 350 and 500cc machines and took part in grands prix in 1960. The company also produced a model for the Italian army and a civilian scooter, the Orsetto 80. Piaggio bought out Bianchi Motorcycles in 1967.
In 1955, Bianchi created a car brand, Autobianchi, in collaboration with Pirelli and Fiat. The three turned out only a handful of models, almost exclusively small cars, the biggest being the short-lived Autobianchi A111. Traditionally, Autobianchi motor vehicles cost more than equivalent Fiat models.
Fiat used Autobianchi to test new production concepts such as glass fibre and front-wheel drive. Eventually, Fiat bought out Autobianchi and integrated it with Lancia. Autobianchi are no longer in production beginning from 1995 when, everywhere except Italy, its Y10 hatchback was rebranded a Lancia.

Audi Sport GmbH

Audi Sport GmbH (formerly quattro GmbH). is a wholly owned private subsidiary of the German automobile manufacturer AUDI AG, part of the Volkswagen Group.
Founded in October 1983 as quattro GmbH, it primarily specialises in producing high performance Audi cars and components, along with purchaser specified customisations. The company's former name was an homage to Audi's original four-wheel drive rally-inspired road car – the Audi Quattro. In 2016, the company was renamed Audi Sport GmbH.
It is located in a site at Neckarsulm, near Stuttgart, in the German State of Baden-Württemberg. With over twenty years experience, their own development and manufacturing factories are based within the larger site of the now defunct German automotive maker (and Wankel pistonless rotary engine pioneer) NSU Motorenwerke AG (NSU), on what is now known as Audi's "aluminium plant", or aluminium site.
Although "quattro GmbH" as a company may be relatively unknown, compared to its parent, Audi, its core products include the Audi RS4, the Audi RS6 and the Audi R8. Furthermore, it is a 'closed company', in that it does not sell its automobiles directly to the public via franchised outlets under its own brand name; instead, they are sold under the Audi marque. However, it does now sell 'quattro GmbH' branded lifestyle products and accessories via Audi franchised outlets and Audi Forum such as that located in the Allianz Arena on the northern outskirts of Munich, Germany.
Audi Sport GmbH specialises in four 'key' areas, including the design, testing and production of specialist and high performance Audi automobiles, such as the Audi RS3, Audi RS4, Audi RS5, Audi RS6, Audi RS7, Audi RS Q3, Audi TTRS and the Audi R8.
They also design and specify roadwheels, and design and produce sports suspension, and the specialist car body parts (such as front bumpers and splitters, side skirts, rear bumpers and diffusers, and rear spoilers) which are mainly used on the Audi "S line" trim specification available on most of the model range.
The Audi RS cars have technology and performance comparable with high performance sports cars such as the Porsche 911. Being based on conventional saloon (sedan) or estate (station wagon) cars, RS models also retain the everyday comfort and practicality of regular mainstream models. They are some of the most powerful vehicles ever offered by Audi. quattro GmbH create, design, develop and produce all RS models in conjunction with parent, AUDI AG.
The "RS" initials are taken from the - literally translated as "racing sport". RS is Audi's highest trim level, positioned distinctly above the "S" ("Sport") specification level of Audi's regular model range. RS cars are usually produced in limited numbers over a limited time scale (historically, nearing the end of the production run of a certain model, before a new evolution or generation of the same model), and pioneer some of Audi's latest and most advanced technology and engineering prowess; therefore, "RS" cars could be described as (and are often marketed via television advertising as) "halo vehicles". Whilst RS cars generally command a much higher purchase price, compared to their 'lesser' brethren, they also retain very high residual values too.
S line is a trim specification that allows customers to effect a sporty appearance in their otherwise mainstream Audi model. Whilst the individual S line parts and components are designed and manufactured by quattro GmbH, Audi "S line" cars are still manufactured in the same AUDI AG factories, on the same production lines as their related models with differing trim levels. Cars with "S line" trim should not be confused with high performance "S" and "RS" models. Audi cars with S line trim bear identical performance figures to their counterparts with SE or base trim levels, with the exception of the Audi Q7 S line with the 3.0 V6 TFSI petrol engines ( for standard, for S line).
quattro GmbH offers potential purchasers of new Audi cars the possibility of customising their new car beyond the scope of "conventional" options, to their own personal desires during the initial manufacturing process. This facility is called Audi exclusive, and extends to virtually all areas of the car. The customer may choose unique exterior paint, in any colour, and be complemented by alloy wheels originally developed by quattro GmbH. For the interior, the upholstery can be finished in various grades and grains of leathers (including nappa), again in a choice of colours. These coloured leathers may also be applied to interior door coverings and rear parcel shelves. Headlining fabrics can be customised in colour, along with seat belt webbing. The interior can be finished with a wide selection of fine wooden trims, sourced from around the world, along with colour coordinated piping on the edges of tailored floor carpet mats. Finally, for the traveling business person, a range of in-car office equipment is available. quattro GmbH first offered this service at the 1995 Frankfurt International Motor Show.
In the current markets, many consumers expect to find their favourite brand logo on objects other than the "car". From 1985, quattro GmbH have developed a range of Audi lifestyle products, known as Audi Accessories. These include mountain bikes and personal leather goods, such as briefcases, handbags, purses and wallets. Their highlight is the "Square chronograph" watch. These products allow Audi owners, and non-owners alike, the ability to express an affinity for the "four rings" emblem, in fields other than cars.
quattro GmbH has historically only been able to produce one specific model at a time at its sole plant at Neckarsulm. Chronologically, the first quattro GmbH model produced was the Audi RS2 Avant, a joint venture between Porsche and quattro GmbH, from 1994-1996 (and actually built at Porsche's Zuffenhausen plant). After this initial joint venture, all subsequent cars have been solely (with the exception of the Audi TT RS) produced at Neckarsulm by quattro GmbH. The second car was the C4 S6 Plus, produced from April 1996 to July 1997. Third was the 2000-2001 B5 RS4 Avant quattro; fourth was the 2003 C5 RS6 quattro; fifth was the 2005 B7 A4 DTM Edition saloon. Sixth out of quattro GmbH was the 2006 B7 RS4 quattro, seventh out of quattro GmbH was the 2006 B7 S4 25Quattro, the eighth was the A4 S Line Special Edition (with 220PS upgrade, black optics pack, ventilated cross-drilled front disc brakes, black exhaust pipes, two tone leather interior) and, as of 2009, the ninth and latest offering is the 2008 C6 RS6 5.0 TFSI quattro.
The Audi R8 is built in a new and totally separate quattro GmbH plant at Neckarsulm.
The latest Audi TT RS and the Audi RS3 are both notable departures from this Neckarsulm-only production tradition. Whilst the TT RS and RS3 were wholly designed, developed and engineered at Neckarsulm by quattro GmbH, they are manufactured alongside their 'lesser' Audi siblings, with the TT RS being manufactured at Győr, Hungary, by AUDI AG subsidiary Audi Hungaria Motor Kft.
quattro GmbH-produced cars from Neckarsulm can be identified by their specific 2nd and 3rd digit of the World Manufacturer Identifier section of the vehicles' Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) - quattro GmbH manufactured cars begin with 'WUA...', whereas cars produced by AUDI AG in Germany begin with 'WAU...'.
The Audi R8 two-seat mid-engined sports car was exclusively designed and developed and is produced by quattro GmbH. An old factory on the Audi Neckarsulm site was redeveloped, and €28millon was invested in the new R8 production line. Around 250 employees work on this car.
The longitudinally orientated 4.2 litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V8 engine used in the R8, rated at and , is shared from the B7 RS4 quattro, but modified to use a dry sump lubrication system and induction system.
A subsequent V10 engined version of the R8 is also available, using a de-tuned version of their sister company's 5.2-litre FSI V10, used in the Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4. This variant produces and .
Furthermore, quattro GmbH unveiled a diesel engined R8 concept, the "R8 V12 TDI" (later renamed "R8 TDI Le Mans"). This was to use a 6.0-litre V12 engine, utilising Volkswagen Group's long-established Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) turbodiesel technology. This engine was rated , and generated of torque.
quattro GmbH has developed the most powerful diesel powered sport utility vehicle (SUV) in its class. The Audi Q7 V12 TDI quattro is fitted with a V12 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) internal combustion engine. A world first, this all new diesel engine displaces 6.0 litres, generating a motive power output of (measured according to Directive 80/1269/EEC) at 4,000 rpm, and of torque at 1,750-3,000 rpm. This is enough to complete the dash in 5.5 seconds, making it perform like modern sports cars. Top speed is electronically limited to . quattro GmbH have developed this new engine using existing technology from Audi's Le Mans endurance racing programme - the Audi R15 TDI.
quattro GmbH is related to Audi in a similar manner to other German car manufacturers' "performance divisions" – such as "Mercedes-AMG GmbH" and Mercedes-Benz, "BMW M GmbH" and BMW, "Volkswagen R GmbH" and Volkswagen, or "Opel Performance Center GmbH" and Opel.
A similar operation called "Volkswagen Individual GmbH", founded February 2003, is provided for Audi's Volkswagen Group sister company Volkswagen Passenger Cars at Wolfsburg. Volkswagen Individual GmbH produce the Volkswagen "R" series of cars, including the Golf R32 and the latest Passat R36, and are also able to provide purchaser requested customisations under the "Volkswagen Individual" label, similar to "Audi exclusive", during the initial factory manufacturing process. This service is also offered routinely to purchasers of Volkswagen Passenger Cars 'flagship' models - the Phaeton and the Touareg, at their respective production plants.

Royal Dutch Mint

The Royal Dutch Mint (Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt) based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, is a company owned entirely by the Dutch State, and since 1807 the only Dutch entity allowed to strike and issue coins.
On 17 September 1806, when The Netherlands were under the rule of King Louis Napoleon, he decided that the striking and distribution of coins should be by a single, national body. This was in contrast to the Middle Ages custom of large trading cities having their own mint and coins, which resulted in several coins circulating within the country, and many levels of controlling bureaucracy.
Originally it was the intention to found the mint in the capital city of Amsterdam but, since there was insufficient finance available, it was decided to locate the National Mint seat in Utrecht.
After Napoleon was defeated in 1813, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands was founded with William I as King, the Mint was renamed as " 's Rijks Munt". What is now known as Belgium was a part of the new kingdom, and a second Mint was located in Brussels. When Belgium achieved independence in 1839, the "Rijks Munt" became the only mint in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The provincial coins had been minted before the unification of the Mint were still in circulation. Due to their relatively high intrinsic value, the "new" coins would only gain popularity with the passage of time. In 1849 the provincial coins were officially taken out of circulation.
In 1901 the company was placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, and in 1912 the Mint officially became a company owned by the State. At the end of the German occupation during the Second World War, in 1944, coins were produced in the United States. This was necessary to ensure that there would be enough currency available after the liberation.
In 1994 " 's Rijks Munt" was renamed as "De Nederlandse Munt NV". It became a company, 100% of whose shares are owned by the Dutch State. The Queen awarded the company the prefix Koninklijk (Royal) five years later, and the company was now allowed to call itself "De Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt" (The Royal Dutch Mint). On 22 November 2016 the Royal Dutch Mint was sold to the Belgian Groep Heylen.
Since 2002 the Royal Dutch Mint has been allowed to strike coins for foreign national banks in the euro zone, and strikes coins for Latvia, Guatemala and Honduras. Furthermore, the Dutch Royal Mint produces commemorative coins and coins intended for collectors (some of these are official coins, some not) and royal medals.
The Royal Dutch Mint was also delegated the task of destroying the old guilders after their replacement by the euro in 2002.

Attic Books

Attic Books, one of Canada's largest used books and antiquarian independent bookstores, is located in London, Ontario. It has been in business for over forty years, and has been in its present location in the heart of downtown London for over twenty years. Specializing in used and antiquarian books, along with maps, prints, and ephemera, Attic Books draws a large variety of customers.
Marvin Post is the owner of Attic Books. He is a member of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB), the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Canada (ABAC), and the Canadian Booksellers Association (CBA). He "appraises a variety of archives, books and related material for a number of public institutions for insurance and tax purposes".
Post was a stamp dealer in 1969. He owned a record store in the early 1970s called B-side Records, which used the label from an antiquarian book press for its symbol, a triad of bumblebees.
He established Attic Books in 1976. He joined the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Canada (ABAC) and the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB) in 1981. He is a regular attendee at the Ottawa Book Fair, the Toronto Antiquarian Book Fair and the Toronto Paper Show.
The store originally opened in 1976 on the top floor of a building at 428 Richmond Street, which currently houses Bob Burke Jewellers. It then moved to the second floor space at 388 Clarence Street. These locations lent themselves well to the shop's name. In the 1980s, development in downtown London forced Attic Books out of its location, and it reopened in Parkhill, Ontario. In 1996, mayor Diane Haskett worked with proprietor Marvin Post to bring Attic Books back to London, Ontario. It is now one of the few longstanding destination businesses in downtown London.
Attic Books in 2006 opened the second floor, which is specialized in antiquarian books, maps and prints, along with sections of collectibles, antiques and books on books. It was previously only available to dealers and known collectors. Now it is open to the public.
Attic Books sells maps and prints. Branching out into the online world of book retail, Attic Books now sells online stock at both ABE, Biblio, Alibris Camazon.ca and Antiqbook. Attic Books also is becoming known for selling curiosities and unusual antiques in addition to books.
Attic Books is one of the very few places where Charles van Sandwyk's fine art and fantasy cards and books can be purchased.

The building at 240 Dundas Street is late Victorian red brick commercial in style. Originally, the building was a single floor and only about 20’ long. It was not expanded until the 1880s, when the second and third floor were added. The second floor was attached to 242 Dundas, creating a large space that accommodated Somerset Hall. Doorways on the main floor also allowed access to the adjacent building. A hoist existed where the current elevator can be found.
During a major renovation in 1919, arts and crafts elements were added to the façade. The back end of the store was extended and a mezzanine was added to the third floor. This renovation was designed and executed by famous London architect J. M. Moore. Before 1919, the building matched the three structures that surround it, two to the west and one to the east. The elevator was installed in 1919, and was made by the Roelofsen Machine and Tool Co. in Galt, Ontario.
The large pane glass windows overlooking the street were installed by McPhillips & Co. in the 1930s. The outer two window panes on each of the upper picture windows pivoted to open like doors. These windows facilitated the movement of pianos from the street to the upper floors for display. They have since been replaced with more energy efficient windows
Marvin Post purchased the building from the Thompson family, owners of Supertest, in 1996. The Thompsons had owned it since the early 1930s. When repainting the elevator, Post removed 35 lbs. of lead paint from the car, unveiling a rainbow of colours that had been added over the years. The alternating dark and light wood on the second level flooring is called a “wedding floor,” made of walnut and maple, and can also be found in 242 Dundas next door. When Post took possession of the building in 1996, the toilets had not been updated, although the plumbing had been. The toilet tanks were still made of wood, and have since been replaced.
The gargoyle overlooking Dundas Street was added by the current owner. It was designed by Florin Musta, and acquired through Tony O’Callaghan of Studio Celtia, former business at 242 Dundas.

In 2009, the Paranormal Knights of London performed an investigation at 240 Dundas Street into the possible presence of a ghost. Activities that have been attributed to the ghost include books flying, lights flickering, and the strong odor of a cigar wafting up from the basement stock room near the original foundations. The staff affectionately calls him Roland.

In 2007, the company launched Spin Master Entertainment, a media division that develops and produces global entertainment properties, characters and content. Spin Master Entertainment has produced five television series, including Bakugan Battle Brawlers, Little Charmers and its current hit PAW Patrol, which is broadcast in over 160 countries and territories globally. In 2014 Spin Master Entertainment launched a news broadcast named TGR.
In 2016, The Ohio Art Company announced that they sold its Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands to Spin Master.
Three college friends from Western Ivey Business School, Ronnen Harary, Anton Rabie and Ben Varadi, founded Spin Master with $10,000 in Toronto in 1994. The company's first product, Earth Buddies, was a small head made out of Kmart pantyhoses and grass seeds, which grew "hair" when watered. The Earth Buddy went on to sell over 26,000 units.
Spin Master's first major success came in 1998 with the launch of the Air Hogs brand, and its first item, the Sky Shark. Developed from the prototype provided by inventors John Dixon and Peter Manning, the Sky Shark was a foam plane that used compressed air to enable outdoor flight. Product development took over two years and more than $500,000, but ended up generating $103 million in revenue over the next few years.
However, Spin Master's largest property to date was Bakugan, a card game developed around plastic marbles which popped open to reveal anime-style characters. Developed in conjunction with Sega Toys, Sega Corp and marketed through the Bakugan TV show (TMS Entertainment, Nelvana Inc.), Bakugan reached almost $1 billion in yearly sales.
In 2008, Spin Master partnered with Cartoon Network to create "multi-category consumer products programs for Spin Master's portfolio of brands." They won the 2009 Toy of the Year award for "Bakugan". Spin Master is also the co-producer of an animated TV series called "".

Introduced in 2014, Zoomer is a robotic dog that won "Innovative Toy of the Year" at the Toy Industry Association's ToTY Awards in 2014. Zoomer Dino won the 2015 ToTY for "Boy Toy of the Year" and "Overall Toy of the Year."
Also part of the Zoomer line are Zoomer Zuppies and Zoomer Chomplingz, smaller, low price point versions of their large counterparts. These smaller Zoomer items feature much of the same technology and interactivity as their larger counterparts.
Acquired by Spin Master in 2013, Meccano (known as Erector Set in the USA) is a European construction brand with over 100 years of history. Spin Master has continued to manufacture and operate Meccano out of their European headquarters. Sets range from multi-build sets, architectural builds, and a build your own R/C car set. In 2015 the company introduced Meccanoid, a robotic building platform that allows children to build a four foot tall robot that can speak, move, and interact using a number of technologies.
PAW Patrol is an original series produced by Spin Master Entertainment, now airing in over 50 countries worldwide, and up to 14 times per week in the United States. PAW Patrol is a TV series for preschoolers in North America.

Spin Master Games is the board game division of the company and includes titles such as:
Sick Bricks is a free-to-play video game and integrated line of collectible mini figures and construction sets. It won one of Techlicious’ 2015 Best of Toy Fair Awards.
The core of Sick Bricks exists as an action RPG title available on Android and iOS which encourages players to "beam" physical figurines into the digital game using the camera on their mobile device. Players can create new versions of existing figurines by physically combining different parts (e.g. arms, legs, head) and then scanning the resulting character into the game.
Acquired in November 2012 from Wild Planet, Spy Gear is a line of spy-themed toys and role play items that aim to empower and inspire kids to become spies themselves. Products are categorized as either Surveillance, Communication, Security, and Spy Essentials.
In 2013 Spy Gear was a McDonald's Happy Meal Partner, winner of an Oppenheimer Toy Portfolio Platinum Award, and winner of the National Parenting Center's Seal of Approval.
Spin Master was once a boy toy market. They had action figures, like Bakugan, but lacked a fashion doll. In 2006, they tried a fashion robot that could move by itself, but this had poor results. They almost gave up, until they finally came up with a new line that was launched in fall 2009: a girl toy line, "Liv World" The characters are Sophie, Katie, Alexis, Daniela, Hayden,and more.
In late 2011, Spin Master released a bunch of NASCAR Toys including replica 1/64th scale cars, haulers, pull back cars, remote control cars, and Bashers. This marks the return of NASCAR in the retail toy aisles since late 2010 when Action pulled the plug. In late 2015, it was then seen in stores that Lionel Racing had taken over NASCAR Authentics, ending Spin Master's 5-year run.
The line features a young city girl named Dee and her friends, Tylie, Cyanne and Sloane, who started their own fashion label of the same name. They are fashion designers and always get inspirations everywhere they go and see in which is the theme of their new outfits. The character Dee also has a pet who shares the same taste for fashion, Le Bun. "Dee-sign Time" is often used for this style of fashion design.
"Rowdy Shouty Chic" is the official tagline.
In January 2016 Spin Master announced the acquisition of Editrice Giochi, an Italian board game publisher founded in 1936 with a large portfolio of board games.

Karachi Shipyard

The Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works Limited (KS&EW), is a major defence contractor and military corporation situated in West Wharf in Karachi, Pakistan.
Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works was established in mid fifties as a project of Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) and incorporated as a public limited company in 1957, managed by a Board of Directors with Managing Director as the Chief Executive.
Karachi Shipyard is situated at west wharf Karachi and spread over an area of 71 acres. It has a large shipbuilding hall, three block fabrication areas, three shipbuilding berths, two dry docks, a well equipped machine shop and a large grit blasting and painting facility with modern machinery for paint application under controlled environment as per international standards. A ship lift and transfer system with a lifting capacity of 7881 tons and 13 in number parking stations is being installed which is planned to complete by end 2016.
Karachi Shipyard is the only shipyard and oldest heavy engineering establishment of Pakistan, catering for shipbuilding, ship repair and general heavy engineering. It has played a historical role in transferring of technologies and broadening the industrial base of country.
Karachi Shipyard is the only shipbuilding company in Pakistan. It has built numerous cargo ships, oil tankers, tugboats and support vessels, landing crafts, naval vessels and submarines.
Karachi Shipyard has recently completed building 17000 tons Fleet Tanker for Pakistan Navy. The construction of the vessel started on 27 November 2013 with steel cutting and subsequently keel laying was performed on 7 March 2014. The construction of the vessel was completed and it was launched on August 19, 2016 by Prime Minister of Pakistan.
PNFT will provide not only logistic support to PN units at high seas but can also undertake ASW/ASvW operation through embarked helicopter. PNFT will be built under the Class and will comply with IMO and MARPOL regulations envogue. For this, the ship is of double hull configuration. It is propelled by two diesel driven engines with controllable pitch propeller and can achieve a top speed of 20 knots. There are 4 x DGs for electrical power generation. With overall length of 158.4 m and maximum width of 22.0 m, the ship has scantling displacement of 17000 tons.
Contract for indigenous construction of a Fleet Tanker for Pakistan Navy was signed on 22 Jan 2013 between Ministry of Defence Production (MoDP), Pakistan and M/s STM of Turkey. As per the said contract, design of the ship alongwith Kit of Material (KoM) will be provided by M/s STM, whereas complete construction, outfitting, and trials will be undertaken by KS&EW. PN Fleet Tanker (PNFT) is the largest warship to be built in country to date.
In the 1990s KS&EW received technology from France for building the Agosta 90B "Khalid class" submarine. The technology was mostly related to construction of the pressure hull and out-fitting of the submarine. Drawings, computer aided design tools and more than 20,000 technical documents from France were transferred. Training programs for 300 engineers and technicians took place in France and another 600 personnel were trained in Pakistan. In 1995, surveys and upgrades to naval dockyard infrastructure were carried out by French personnel which included a section building hall, combined outfitting workshop, pipe-bending workshop, hull fabrication workshop, grit blasting and painting facility, dock lift system and a pickling and etching plant. 
The third Agosta 90B submarine, PNS Hamza, was constructed with the newly developed MESMA air-independent propulsion unit, while the first two (PNS Khalid and PNS Saad) will be retro-fitted during their next overhauls with a "plug" containing a MESMA AIP unit. The submarine's hull will be cut and the plug inserted. The second MESMA unit was shipped in June 2011.
The next submarine project will see KS&EW jointly involved with Chinese company CSOC (China Shipbuilding & Offshore International Co. Ltd.) in the design and construction of six submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion (AIP). These will be designed to Pakistani specifications and four will be built at a CSOC shipyard in China, while two will be constructed by KS&EW. It is believed that little upgrading of facilities is required because much of the current infrastructure meets the requirements. The preliminary negotiations were reported to be completed in March 2011. It was earlier believed that the project would involve China's Type-041 "Yuan class" submarine, which had been mentioned by Admiral Noman Bashir, Chief of Naval Staff, several times since 2009.

American News Company

American News Company was a magazine, newspaper, book, and comic book distribution company founded in 1864 by Sinclair Tousey, which dominated the distribution market in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The company's abrupt 1957 demise caused a huge shakeup in the publishing industry, forcing many magazine, comic book, and paperback publishers out of business.
The American News Company had its roots in two New York City newspaper and periodical wholesaling firms: Sinclair Tousey's company on Nassau St., and the firm Dexter, Hamilton & Co. at 22 Ann St. These were the two largest news and periodical wholesalers in New York City at the time of their merger on Feb. 1, 1864, when American News Company was formed. The seven original partners were Sinclair Tousey, John E. Tousey, Harry Dexter, George Dexter, John Hamilton, Patrick Farrelly, and Solomon W. Johnson. These partners formed the core of the company's management up until the death of the last surviving partner, Solomon Johnson, in 1913. Sinclair Tousey was the company's first president, followed after his death by Harry Dexter, who was succeeded by Solomon Johnson.
The company's Boston branch was formed by taking over the wholesale periodical business of Boston bookseller Alexander Williams. In 1854 Williams had bought out the business of Fetridge & Co., which operated on the corner of State St. and Washington a large magazine store known as the Periodical Depot or the Periodical Arcade. Williams worked up an extensive trade as a jobber of newspapers and periodicals to out of town dealers all over the East Coast, and by the time ANC was organized the wholesale side of the business had grown too large for Williams to handle alone. Along with two smaller competing firms, Dyer & Co. and Federhen & Co., the Boston trade was reorganized as a subsidiary of American News under the name New England News Company, with Williams as one of the principal shareholders. Initially an officer of the new corporation, Williams was a bookstore proprietor at heart and left soon afterward in 1869 to take over the famous "Old Corner Bookstore".
Two years after the company formed it added to its newspaper and magazine business a book jobbing department, under the supervision of a Mr. Dunham; this grew to be one of the largest in the country.
With the end of the Civil War, the firm grew rapidly along the expanding railroads as they opened up the West, with the commencement of coast-to-coast continental rail service in 1869. Legislation passed by Congress required the railroads to transport newspapers and periodicals as second class bulk mail at a special low subsidized rate—one cent per pound for any distance between news agencies, so that a bundle of New York newspapers could be sent across the continent to Los Angeles for the same price that it could be shipped across the river to Newark—and ANC exploited the availability of cheap rail transport to expand their distribution network across the continent, so far ahead of the competition that they effectively shut any possible rivals out of the market, establishing their periodical depots by the hundreds in every city and large town on the rail system. At the same time, the number of periodicals being published in America was exploding: Frank Mott, in "A History of American Magazines", estimates that the number of titles being published boomed from 700 at the end of the Civil War to 3300 in 1885.
In 1893 an article in "The American Newsman" summed up the company's success: "It is as the keeper of a thousand secrets involving the fortunes of publishers and authors that the American News Company surrounds its vast and intricate system with an atmosphere of mystery, so that few persons have any idea of its really astounding proportions. It has gradually absorbed the smaller organizations until it now embraces thirty-two powerful news companies, with an annual operating expense of $2,488,000 and an annual business of something like $18,000,000. This organization handles the bulk of the reading matter of the United States and supplies nearly nineteen thousand dealers."
On any given day, a hundred new issues of the thousands of titles ANC handled would typically be fed into the ANC distribution system. In New York City alone (at that time consisting solely of Manhattan and the Bronx) 125 wagons and drivers crisscrossed the city every day making deliveries, with 14 local neighborhood substations.
ANC employed directly in 1893 1,154 people, with a weekly payroll of $16,255; with $1 million in real estate holdings and $1.4 million in merchandise on hand. It extended extensive credit to the firms it did business with and $800,000 was due at any given time in accounts receivable from dealers around the country. It owned outright 18 buildings around the country and rented 39 more, and had $200,000 invested in horses and wagons. The branches of the company at this time were located in Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Montreal, Newark, New Orleans, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Providence, San Francisco, Springfield (Mass.), St. Louis, St. Paul, Toronto, Troy, and Washington D.C. These branches were organized as subsidiaries under different names, for example the Chicago branch was the Great Western News Company, founded in 1866. The International News Company, on Duane Street in New York, was the branch handling the company's extensive overseas business. A branch called the Union News Company existed solely to sell newspapers and magazines on the railroads, with 300 newsstands in railroad stations which by 1893 covered 40% of the entire US railroad system, paying $1000 a day for exclusive rights. Under this system Union News could keep the "Chicago Tribune" out of the Chicago area train stations until the "Tribune" agreed to their terms. In 1958 the FTC found that Union News was operating nearly a thousand newsstands around the country (the next largest operator had 57), putting Union News in a position to dictate terms and demand rebates from publishers.
Typically, in the post-Civil War era, ANC in its position as the middleman between publishers and newsstand dealers would allow the newsstand dealers to keep between 5 and 10 cents on the sale of a 35-cent magazine like the monthly "Harper's", and three cents on a 10-cent magazine like "Harper's Weekly". Unsold copies of most titles were fully returnable, although some titles were sold to the dealers as non-returnable at a steeper discount, similar to today's "direct sale" comic book market.
American News's monopoly position in the market was virtually unchallenged until Frank Munsey, frustrated by ANC's refusal to handle his cheap 10 cent pulp magazines, was forced to set up his own distribution, Red Star News. This was the first of the so-called ID or independent distributors. Munsey balked when ANC informed him that 4 cents was the most they would pay wholesale for a magazine that sold for 10 cents retail, and Munsey retaliated by cutting out the middleman and setting up his own distributor to sell directly to newsdealers for 7 cents a copy. Munsey was followed in time by Hearst, Fawcett, Curtis, Annenberg and Donenfeld, all constrained by various factors into setting up their own independent distribution networks outside the ANC monopoly; nonetheless ANC remained by far the dominant firm up until its collapse.
American News functioned both as a national distributor and as a local periodical wholesaler. After World War II, headed by Henry Garfinkle, the company had over 300 branches blanketing the United States, and employed several thousand employees. During the middle of the century, American News stood as the largest book wholesaler in the world, dominating the industry. It also had a near stranglehold on the distribution of magazines and newspapers within the United States market, dominating that industry as well. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it had more than 5400 stockholders. Headquartered in New Jersey, American News also had offices in downtown Manhattan.
Comic book clients of American News included Atlas Comics, Dell Comics, and Toby Press. National Comics had its own distributor, Independent News Company, and was able to take on distribution for other comic book publishers after American News failed. Comic book publishers who were not able to come to terms with National's distributors quickly went under, and others were limited in the number of titles they were allowed to distribute under the new arrangements—Atlas (later known as Marvel Comics) was rationed to eight titles a month. The change also affected paperback book publishers like Lion Library, which went out of business when Independent News (which was already distributing rival New American Library) refused to take it on. Avon paperbacks, which had been founded as a subsidiary of ANC in 1941 in the early days of the paperback boom, managed to survive the crash and was taken over by Hearst.
Many magazines distributed in the 1940s were in pulp format; by the end of 1955, all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format. This change was largely the work of the refusal of American News and other distributors to carry the pulp magazines since they were no longer profitable. The 1950s boom in science fiction magazine publishing, with 30 new titles being launched, turned overnight into collapse with the failure of ANC. Other pulp fiction genres—western, romance, detective—suffered a similar extinction event. These sections of the magazine field were already in decline and it was simply not worth the effort to rescue already marginal magazine titles.
In 1952 the government began antitrust litigation against ANC which was destined to drag on until the company's demise. Around 1955 major magazine publishers began disengaging themselves from ANC and making other arrangements for newsstand distribution. When "Collier's" and "Woman's Home Companion", two of their biggest-selling titles, folded in January 1957, it came as a serious blow to ANC at a time when the company was already on financially shaky ground. In April Dell Publishing announced that they were pulling out and making other arrangements for their distribution.
The mammoth company's abrupt demise in June 1957 has been a source of speculation for decades. One theory is that a speculator became aware that a bookkeeping peculiarity in American News' accounts could allow a large profit from liquidating the company. He acquired control, and proceeded to sell off the assets, ultimately winding the company up. This theory was summarized in a 1960 lawsuit:
An alternative (but somewhat similar explanation) for the company's demise has been offered by comic book historian and author Gerard Jones. The company in 1956...
The effect on the American magazine market was catastrophic. Many magazines had to switch to one of the independent distributors, who were able to set their own conditions for taking on new business. This often forced the magazines to change from a digest size to a larger format, and to become monthly rather than bimonthly or quarterly. Many magazines could not afford to make these changes, both of which required either high circulation or a strong advertising base, and many magazines folded as a result.
An example of a company that the change in distributor had a drastic impact on is Atlas Comics, which was forced to switch distribution to Independent News, owned by National Periodical Publications, owner of Atlas' rival, DC Comics. Because of this, Atlas was constrained as to its publishing output for the next decade (including the early years of its successor, Marvel Comics).

JLG Industries

JLG Industries, Inc., an Oshkosh Corporation company, is an American designer, manufacturer and marketer of access equipment (aerial work platforms and telehandlers). The company’s products extend beyond its own well-known brand of AWPs and telehandlers to SkyTrak and Lull telehandlers; TRIPLE-L trailers, LiftPod, and a growing line of JLG vertical and mobile stock picking lifts for material handling applications.
Founded in 1969, John Landis Grove formed a partnership with two close friends and bought a small metal fabrication business in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania. With a crew of 20 workers, they built and sold the first JLG aerial work platform in 1970. Many of the basic design elements of that original lift are still being incorporated into products today.
Since becoming part of the Oshkosh Corporation Company in late 2006, JLG has seen three appointed presidents. Craig E. Paylor was named president in 2006. Paylor was with JLG since 1978 and held roles primarily in the areas of sales, marketing and business development. During his nearly 30 years with JLG, the company grew from a $25 million company to over the $3 billion mark. Upon Paylor's retirement in 2010, Wilson Jones took his place. Jones was an Oshkosh Corporation executive vice president and president of Oshkosh's Fire and Emergency segment. On August 1, 2012, Wilson Jones was promoted to president and chief operating officer (COO) of Oshkosh Corporation. Succeeding Jones was Frank Nerenhausen, who is the current president of JLG and remains an Oshkosh Corporation executive vice president.

Pearson's Candy Company

Pearson's Candy Company is an American chocolate and confectionery manufacturer headquartered in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Founded as a confectionery distribution firm in 1909, the company began to manufacture its own products in 1912. Originally a family-owned company, Pearson's experienced changes in ownership, acquisitions and product alterations in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s before its most recent sale to Brynwood Partners VI in August 2011.
Pearson's products are produced on five production lines in the company’s Saint Paul plant. The company sells its Mint Patties, Salted Nut Roll and Bit-O-Honey nationally and its Nut Goodie and Bun Bars products in several Midwestern states. As of late 2014, Pearson's was estimated to be the 31st largest confectionery company in North America by revenue.
Pearson's Candy Company was founded as a confectionery distribution firm in 1909 by P. Edward Pearson and his brothers, John and Oscar. Two more brothers, Waldemar and C. Fritz, joined the company several years later. The five brothers determined manufacturing would be more profitable than distribution and, in 1912, introduced their first confection, the Nut Goodie.
Pearson's grew and began manufacturing for other companies, including Whitmans and Planters. Pearson's introduced the Salted Nut Roll in 1933, at the height of The Great Depression. The success of the Salted Nut Roll prompted other manufacturers to mimic the confection. Pearson's subsequently changed the roll's name to the Choo Choo Bar, to distinguish the product. The Choo Choo name, however, was not as successful, and the original name was restored with the Pearson's logo more prominently displayed.
By the end of World War II, the Pearson brothers had dropped the distribution aspect of the business. The youngest brother, William Pearson, joined the family business in 1944, as did George Pearson, son of founder P. Edward Pearson. In 1951, Pearson's acquired the Trudeau Candy Company, which brought Mint Patties and the Seven Up bar to Pearson's product line. The company moved to a new manufacturing plant at its current address in 1959. In 1962, Pearson’s acquired Milwaukee-based Sperry Candy Company, a company known for its Chicken Dinner Bar. Pearson's, however, sold Sperry Candy to the Schuler Chocolate Factory of Winona, Minnesota five years later.
The Pearson family sold the company in 1968 to ITT/Continental Baking, a New York firm. ITT/Continental Baking sold the company to an out-of-state confectionery partnership in 1979. During this time, sales declined due to problems with availability and product changes, such as a wrapper redesign and recipe change of the Nut Goodie.
In 1985, the company was purchased by Larry Hassler and Judith Johnston. The company’s previous owners had split up, causing the bank to offer the company in the leveraged buyout. The Nut Goodie's original wrapper and recipe were restored and, despite the loss of a label contract with General Mills to produce Nature Valley granola bars, which accounted for 1.4 million bars daily and 85 percent of the company's total tonnage, Pearson's became profitable again in December 1992. In early 1998, Pearson's acquired the Bun Bar trademark from Clark Bar America. Pearson's introduced Flurries in 2004.
In August 2011, Pearson's was acquired by Brynwood Partners IV.
Salted Nut Rolls are the company's best selling product, and together with Mint Patties account for approximately 80 percent of the company’s sales. Mint Patties are sold nationally and Salted Nut Rolls are available in approximately 60 percent of the company's outlets. In late 2013, Pearson's acquired the Bit-O-Honey brand from Nestle USA, Inc. Although the company sells its products primarily in the United Sates, it has ranked among the largest confectionery companies in the world, and as of late 2014, was estimated to be the 31st largest confectionery company in North America by revenue.
Pearson's utilizes 200 tons of peanuts, 400 tons of sugar, 100 tons of chocolate and 350 tons of corn syrup per month. Products are produced in the company’s plant on five production lines. Current products include:
The Seven Up Bar was a candy bar comprising seven different chocolate "pillows", each filled with a different flavor. Flavors changed with the availability and popularity of ingredients, which included, among others, brazil nut, buttercream, butterscotch, caramel, cherry, coconut, fudge, mint, nougat and orange. The high manufacturing costs and trademark issues with a soda manufacturer (The American Bottling Company, today Cadbury Schweppes), caused the bar to be retired in 1979.
The Chicken Dinner Bar had been a product of the Sperry Candy Company, which was acquired by Pearson’s in 1962. The bar, introduced during The Great Depression, was so called in reference to President Herbert Hoover’s promise of “a chicken in every pot”. The bar did not contain chicken or other poultry products, but was, rather, a chocolate-covered nut roll. Pearson’s discontinued the bar’s production after the acquisition. Early TV commercials sang "Chick - Chick - Chick - Chick - Chicken Dinner" similar to, and in the cadence of a rooster crowing.

Robert Dyas

Robert Dyas is a UK retailer founded in London in 1872. Currently owned by entrepreneur Theo Paphitis. The website and stores provide ranges of housewares, small electrical appliances, gardening products, kitchenwares, DIY, and consumer electronics throughout 96 stores, mainly in Greater London and South East England.
Since 2012 Robert Dyas has been owned by Theo Paphitis, the entrepreneur and long-time star of BBC's Dragons' Den.
Almost exactly a century before Theo Paphitis emigrated to the UK, the founder Robert Dyas emigrated to England from County Meath, Ireland. With an inheritance of just £5 he opened his first shop in the capital in 1872. By the time of his death at the age of 66 he had established 18 stores. His sons took over after that, followed by his two grandsons who died in 1961 and 2002.
Robert Dyas has survived several catastrophes including the Great Depression and the Blitz in which the head office, warehouse and 18 stores were destroyed.
In 1997, Robert Dyas's head office and warehouse burnt down in Croydon; the head office is now in Leatherhead, Surrey.
In March 2004, Robert Dyas was bought by Change Capital Partners, a private equity firm headed by former Marks & Spencer chairman Luc Vandevelde.
By spring 2009, the company had come close to collapse with rumoured debts of £30 million. Change Capital Partners had lost control of the company to Lloyds Banking Group and Allied Irish Banking Group who owned the debt. Following a management buy-out, backed by the Lloyds Banking Group on 8 April steps were taken by September of that year to secure its viability through a debt-for-equity deal that gave its lenders a majority stake in the chain.
In 2010–2011, Robert Dyas introduced a new trading format, increased its online offering and expanded the use of web kiosks and browsers.
The company was put up for sale in November 2011 by the Lloyds Banking Group and Allied Irish Banking Group. Following a sale process led by Cavendish Corporate Finance, the company was successfully sold in July 2012 to Theo Paphitis.
Robert Dyas currently operates around 96 standalone shops (growing to 97 in April 2014). Stores vary in size from a large right down to . These are mainly found in London and the south east of England, but also exist as far away as Bristol in the West and Solihull and Kenilworth in the West Midlands.
In 2013 a rolling programme of introducing electronic displays into stores was started. Now 20 stores have both electronic screens in stores, showing infomercials, plus screens in front windows showing electronic posters. Store teams also use portable tablets to help customer purchasing decisions and improve their overall shopping experience.
The product range is primarily focused on housewares and light DIY. Core departments include kitchenware, vacuums and kitchen appliances, steam cleaning, cleaning chemicals and laundry products, garden care, outdoor leisure, DIY tools and materials, home office and technology. The business has also expanded into seasonal gifting ranges at key times of the year.

Ahrens-Fox Fire Engine Company

The Ahrens-Fox Fire Engine Company is an Ohio-based fire truck manufacturer. The company was founded in 1910 by John P Ahrens and Charles H Fox and built its first motorized fire engine in 1911. By the end of the following year production of horse-drawn fire apparatus ceased completely. Since then, over 1500 pieces of fire apparatus were built until 1977. Ahrens-Fox fire engines were recognizable by the chromed sphere above the pump that held air and smoothed the outgoing pressure fluctuations from the piston pump.
During the year 1913 only, Ahrens-Fox built a 44 hp (following then-actual rating practice) automobile. Like at rival American LaFrance, the idea was to sell these cars to bigger fire brigades as a car of duty for their chiefs. Also like at ALF, it was not successful for Ahrens-Fox either, although for Ahrens-Fox the results were more consequential; there was only one model, a huge six-cylinder called the "E-C Battalion Roadster". It was guaranteed to go faster than 50 mph, and featured a four speed gearbox. A small pickup bed was added for some items that were thought to be useful for the head of a fire brigade, and was included in the base price. Only six of these roadster-pickups were built during 1913; it seems all stayed in Cincinnati. Ahrens-Fox abandoned the idea and never returned to it.
Today, Ahrens-Fox and all of its assets, parts, and paper is owned by W. Kenneth Menke III, president of the Fire Products Company (Powerarc), Webster Groves, Missouri. The Ahrens-Fox name is licensed to HME, Incorporated, which also manufactured Hendrickson Trucks.
The old Ahrens-Fox factory at 214 East 14th Street in Over-the-Rhine has been converted into luxury condominiums.

Arch Coal

Arch Coal is an American coal mining and processing company. The company mines, processes, and markets bituminous and sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content in the United States. Arch Coal is the second largest supplier of coal in the U.S. behind Peabody Energy. The company supplies 15% of the domestic market. Demand comes mainly from generators of electricity.
Arch Coal operates 32 active mines and controls approximately 5.5 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves, located in Central Appalachia, the Powder River Basin, Illinois basin and the Western Bituminous regions. The company operates mines in Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming, and is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. The company sells a substantial amount of its coal to producers of electric power, steel producers and industrial facilities.
Arch Coal was formed in July 1997 through the merger of publicly traded Ashland Coal, Inc. and privately held Arch Mineral Corporation. Arch Mineral had its origins in 1969, when it was formed as a partnership between Ashland Oil (now Ashland Inc.) and the H.L.Hunt family of Dallas, Texas; Ashland Coal was formed in 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Oil. With the completion of the merger, Arch became the leading producer of low-sulfur coal in the eastern United States.
In June 1998, Arch Coal expanded into the western United States with the acquisition of the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield. Included in this transaction were the Black Thunder Coal Mine and Coal Creek mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming; the West Elk longwall mine in Gunnison County, Colorado; and a 65% interest in Canyon Fuel Company, which operates three longwall mines in Utah.
In October 1998, Arch added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Thundercloud, a 412-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder mine.
In July 2004, Arch Coal solidified its position as a leading producer of high-Btu, low-sulfur western bituminous coal with the acquisition of the remaining 35% interest in Canyon Fuel Company and its 161-million-ton reserves.
In August 2004, Arch again expanded its position in the Powder River Basin with the acquisition of Triton's North Rochelle mine adjacent to Arch's existing Black Thunder operation. By integrating the North Rochelle mine with Black Thunder, Arch created the premier mine in the nation's fastest growing coal supply region.
In September 2004, Arch again added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Little Thunder, a 719-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder Coal Mine.
In December 2005, Arch Coal sold select eastern assets to Magnum Coal Company to unlock the value of some of its Central Appalachian holdings, sharpened its focus in that region, and strengthened its balance sheet in preparation for future growth.
In August 2006, Arch acquired a one-third interest in Knight Hawk Coal, a growing coal producer in the Illinois Basin.
In October 2009, Arch acquired Rio Tinto's Jacobs Ranch mine and blended it with Black Thunder Coal Mine in the southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming, creating the single largest coal mining complex in the world.
In November 2009, Arch acquired the rights to mine 731 million tons of Otter Creek coal reserves in the northern Powder River Basin of Montana.
On June 15, 2011, Arch acquired International Coal Group (ICG) and cemented its place as a top five global coal supplier and a top 10 metallurgical coal producer and marketer.
In December 2011, Arch Coal became the successful bidder for a 222 million ton federal coal lease known as the South Hilight tract in the southern Powder River Basin.
In June 2013, Arch Coal announced the planned sale of its Canyon Fuel Company LLC subsidiary to Bowie Resources, LLC. Canyon Fuel includes the Sufco, Skyline and Dugout Canyon mines in Utah.
In January 2016, Arch Coal filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This was stated to be a part of a restructuring aiming at reducing debt by $4.5 billion.
On October 5, 2016, Arch Coal emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company won a court approval allowing them to erase almost $5 billion in debt and left bankruptcy with $300 million in cash. Arch Coal resumed trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ARCH. Unsecured creditors and bondholders will receive $30 million in cash along with 6% of the new shares according to court agreements. Bondholders will also have the option to receive either warrants to buy up to 12% of the company's new stock or an additional $25 million cash.
Arch Coal PAC is named, along with other major coal producers, as a donor to the 2004 election campaign in West Virginia. 2004 was a record-setting year for donations made by the coal industry.
Arch is number 564 in the 2013 Fortune 1000 list. They are the second largest coal producer in the United States.
Arch Coal practices mountaintop removal mining, which is controversial because it reduces the height of mountaintops
Their West Virginia mining operations in the Appalachian Mountains were the subject of a critical documentary in 2002 on "Now with Bill Moyers" on PBS. Arch's Dal-Tex mining operations above the town of Blair, West Virginia were the subject of a 1998 U.S. News & World Report story "Shear Madness" by Penny Loeb. The story documented the impacts of mountaintop removal on communities close to the mines and their subsequent depopulation. A 1999 lawsuit brought by the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, "Bragg v. Robertson" was the first successful citizen lawsuit to stop Arch's proposed mountaintop removal valley fill. The fill would have buried several miles of stream at Pigeon Roost Hollow near Blair, West Virginia.
In his ruling for the plaintiffs, Judge Charles H. Haden stated that "If there is any life form that cannot acclimate to life deep in a rubble pile, it is eliminated. No effect on related environmental values is more adverse than obliteration...Under a valley fill the water quality of the stream becomes zero. Because there is no stream, there is no water quality."
As of 2012, the company reported that surface mining in Appalachian mountains accounted for roughly 4 percent of its annual coal production.
Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups announced a campaign in 2015 against Arch Coal's mine project in the Sunset Roadless Area of Gunnison National Forest.
Arch Coal used more than $1 billion in "self-bonding" to guarantee it could pay for its mine reclamation obligations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. After Arch Coal declared bankruptcy, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality agreed to accept $75 million in place of the company’s $486 million in self-bonding liability to the state. 
Arch Coal’s subsidiary operations reported a water compliance rate of 99.9 percent over a 10-year period between 2002 and 2012.
In 2012, Arch Coal became the first energy company to earn the Conservation Legacy Award from the National Museum of Forest Service History. The Museum of Forest Service History awarded this honor “in recognition of [Arch Coal’s] commitment to the protection of natural resources, wildlife and water quality values during mining and restoration operations”.

Draft:Hypertherm

Hypertherm is an American corporation which designs and manufactures advanced cutting systems such as plasma cutting machinery and related high-technology industrial applications for specific use in a wide variety of industries such as shipbuilding, manufacturing, and automotive repair. It also develops and produces man-portable handheld and mechanized plasma cutters, fiber lasers, and waterjet cutting systems, along with consumables, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) motion and height controls, and nesting and process optimization software. The company employs around 1,400 people: approximately 1,100 people at its main headquarters in New Hampshire, and another 300 throughout its international offices in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
Plasma cutting was accidentally discovered in the 1950s by scientists working for the U.S. defense industry. The scientists learned that increasing the gas flow and reducing the opening in the gas nozzle used in TIG welding would result in the formation of a plasma jet. However the technique wasn’t widely used because a phenomenon called double arcing (in which one arc forms between the plasma electrode and nozzle and a second arc forms between the electrode and nozzle), damaging both the electrode and cutting nozzle. Eight years later, in an attempt to control double arcing, a dual flow technique was introduced. The technique involved adding a second gas shield around the plasma nozzle. Although lessened, double arcing was still a problem. It wasn't until 1968, when Dick Couch, who went on to found Hypertherm, invented Water Injection Cutting, a process that involved radially injecting water into the nozzle. The end result was a faster and better cut, as well as less dross and the virtual elimination of double arcing. It is this invention, that made plasma cutting a viable option for companies needing to cut metal. The initial discovery of Water Injection Cutting was followed four years later by Hypertherm's introduction of a water muffler and water table that lessened the noise, smoke, and light that traditionally occurred during the cutting process.
Hypertherm’s very first plasma cutter, the PAC400, used techniques patented by the company. It brought an alternative way to cut through metal. The PAC400 was followed by a number of other inventions including the invention in 1990 of a plasma system that could successfully cut up to 4 ½ inches of metal under 15 feet of water. This breakthrough was embraced by the atomic power industry as it helped in the dismantling of old power plants.
Since those early years, Hypertherm has introduced several patented technologies to make the cutting of metal faster, easier, and better. Technology unveiled since 1989 alone includes the introduction of Hypertherm’s floating shield technology in which a thin, electrically insulated copper shield makes it possible to drag cut. The end result for customers is better work piece piercing with less wear on the nozzle.
In 1990, Hypertherm came out with its HyDefinition technology . A major advancement in mechanized plasma cut quality, HyDefinition cutting resulted in a squared-off cut edge, reduced angle variation and reduced kerf width for a new level of cut quality. In 1999, Hypertherm’s coaxial-assist jet technology hit the market. The technology worked to direct shield gas flow parallel to the plasma arc using a common axis. This made it possible for people to cut faster on thicker plate. Cut speed improvements of up to 50 percent, improved thick plate piercing capabilities, and dross-free performance also resulted. One year later, Hypertherm introduced its CoolCore technology in which a ring-shaped, rather than solid, piece of hafnium is inserted into the electrode. This ring-shape provided additional cooling in the center of the electrode quadrupling its life in high-current applications.
The 2003 introduction of HyPerformance plasma took HyDefinition cutting to the next level by delivering HyDefinition cut quality at faster speeds using half the power. Cut edge angularity using HyPerformance plasma is so good, it is often considered a worthy alternative to laser in many cutting applications.
The 2006 unveiling of the powerful Powermax30 was notable for its small size, light weight, and ability to plug in to regular 120 volt household power, making it a good option for do it yourselfers and home hobbyists. The 20-pound system came with a recommended 1/4" cut and 1/2" severance capacity and a redesigned torch with a tapered front that made it easier for operators to see and move the torch in hard to reach areas. 2008 brought two new major introductions: the unveiling of Hypertherm’s Powermax45, a more powerful yet still lightweight system suited for both handheld and mechanized applications, and the HyPerformance HPR400XD.
During the summer of 2010, the company introduced a new set of systems (the Powermax65 and Powermax85) with an all new torch design. The torches, marketed under the Duramax name, were designed to be more durable and rugged. Another benefit of the Duramax torch line was the introduction of the first 15 degree (nearly straight) hand torch. Up until that time, all plasma torches had a curve of about 90 degrees.
In November 2010, Hypertherm introduced its first non-plasma cutting system, a 1.5 kilowatt fiber laser system called the HyIntensity HFL015. The company said the system was the first fiber laser specifically optimized for metal cutting.
Hypertherm holds more than 115 patents which it actively protects. In 2005, Hypertherm filed suit against the American Torch Tip Corporation for infringing four patented technologies proven to deliver faster cut speeds, longer consumable life, improved cut quality, better torch cooling, and dross-free performance. In March 2009, the company announced a favorable settlement in that suit which included a cash payment from ATTC to Hypertherm, and an agreement that ATTC would stop producing the parts at issue in the lawsuit. ATTC also said it would destroy key parts in its inventory for Hypertherm’s HyPerformance HPR systems. In a press release, Hypertherm's general manager was quoted as saying:
“Hypertherm devotes an enormous amount of resources to the development of technologically advanced plasma cutting systems and consumables. We believe that our innovations deliver unique advantages and superior productivity and profitability for Hypertherm’s customers. As such, we are very protective of our inventions and will use whatever legal means necessary to ensure that our patents are not violated.”
In January 2014, Hypertherm announced the transfer of all common stock into an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), making the company 100 percent employee owned under an S-Corporation structure.
Previously, Hypertherm’s ESOP, known internally as the Hypertherm Stock Ownership Plan or HSOP, held approximately one-third of the company’s stock. Controlling shareholders Dick and Barbara Couch created the plan in 2001, followed by a Global Stock Value Program (GSVP) for international associates in 2004.
Hypertherm is routinely named a "Best Company to Work For" on both the state and national level. In addition, the company has received several more awards honoring its work in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). While not all-inclusive, a listing of some awards follow.

Itek

Itek Corporation was a United States defense contractor that initially specialized in camera systems for spy satellites and various other reconnaissance systems. In the early 1960s they built a conglomerate in a fashion similar to LTV or Litton, during which time they developed the first CAD system and explored optical disc technology. These efforts were unsuccessful, and the company shed divisions to various companies, returning to its roots in the reconnaissance market. The remaining portions were eventually purchased by Litton in 1983, and then Hughes, Raytheon, and Goodrich Corporation.
Richard Leghorn was a former United States Air Force (USAF) aerial reconnaissance expert who had first proposed flying reconnaissance missions over enemy territory in peacetime. Leghorn left the Air Force to become head of Eastman Kodak's European division, and started writing about the "Open Skies" proposal, which he strongly supported.
Open Skies proposed to allow any signing nation to overfly any other, which Leghorn believed would lower international tensions by allowing countries to verify the actions of their adversaries. Eisenhower raised the issue at the 1955 Geneva summit meetings as a way to reduce mutual fears of a surprise attack. At the time, the United States would have had a huge advantage if Open Skies was adopted, as their numerous European and Asian airbases would allow them access to the Soviet heartland, while the lack of USSR bases in the Americas — this being prior to the Cuban Revolution — would have made the treaty an empty promise. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets opposed Open Skies, something Eisenhower later admitted he fully expected.
While Leghorn's writings on the topic were being widely read, he was secretly informed that the United States had already taken him up on his initial proposal, and the United States Air Force (and Royal Air Force) were in the process of flying reconnaissance flights over the USSR. Aware that this would generate vast amounts of photography over long periods of time, Leghorn realized that a major problem would be storing the resulting imagery and allowing it to be easily retrieved for study. Kodak was in the process of introducing its "Minicard" aperture card product, and Leghorn felt this was a natural solution for the problem. Leghorn sought improvement by combining it with machinery dedicated to the task of indexing the information required for reconnaissance. Leghorn contacted his long-time friend Theodore "Teddy" Walkowicz about forming a new company to build such a machine for the Air Force. Walkowicz was an associate of venture capitalist Laurance Rockefeller, and eventually secured a seed loan for $600,000 in exchange for a directorship. Leghorn became president of the new company, whose ITEK name was a phonetic short form of "information technology". Since Leghorn formerly worked at Kodak, there is speculation that the company name was an acronym for "I Took Eastman Kodak".
Weeks after the company formed in late 1957, Leghorn took it in an entirely different direction by purchasing the Boston University Physical Research Laboratory (BUPRL), which researched reconnaissance cameras. BUPRL was designing the HYAC-1 camera for the USAF's reconnaissance balloon efforts, cameras that would eventually fly on the WS-461L balloons during 1957. Now at Itek, the company won contracts for similar cameras for aircraft like the U-2 and SR-71.
The CIA quickly informed them of their top secret Corona to produce the first spy satellites, and asked them to bid on the camera systems. Itek returned a design that used a rotating mirror to record panoramic swaths of the ground. Film was delivered from a canister and wrapped around a cylindrical window that allowed the maximum length of film to be used in a single exposure, increasing resolution. The rotation of the mirror was timed to properly account for the movement of the satellite to avoid stretching the images on-film. The result was a single long photograph showing a "strip" of land. At the time, the CIA had already contracted Fairchild Camera and Instrument to supply cameras, but Itek's submission was technically superior and won them the contract in March or April 1958. To soften the blow, the CIA had Fairchild build the devices until Itek could start its own manufacturing capabilities.
Leghorn was upset by the terms of the agreement, and at one point in 1959 issued a "stop work" order on the project to change its terms. The CIA quickly acquiesced, although they were spooked by the event. Had Itek lost the Corona contract, it was highly likely that the company would have collapsed. This possibility so worried the CIA that they arranged a personal meeting between Rockefeller and the CIA's chief of technical development, Richard Bissell, to inform Rockefeller of the Corona project and make him aware that national security rested on the company's well-being. Leghorn, he felt, needed direct supervision.
Shortly after winning Corona, Itek also won the contract for the Air Force's satellite program, SAMOS. SAMOS originally envisioned a semi-real-time system that downloaded imagery via an onboard scanner, but later expanded to envision a number of different imaging systems based on a single airframe. One of these, E-5, was a project to provide low-resolution wide-area imagery for mapping purposes, which the Air Force needed to plan ingress routes for bombers during war. The SAMOS project was eventually abandoned, leaving several of the E-5 cameras in storage at a Lockheed facility.
After winning the CORONA contract, Itek quickly grew from the executive staff to a company employing over a hundred scientists, engineers, and technicians. After only a year its revenues were in the millions, and the company started the process of raising an initial public offering. In public the company stated that while their work was classified, they were working in the field of "information management" (some writers have commented that this may be the first use of the term). The real reasons for this growth - the BURPL purchase - remained secret, so on paper it appeared that Itek's information systems were generating huge orders that demanded a large staff. Writers speculated that the military might allow the company to release their work to the public, making the company highly valuable. Over the space of a few months, the value of the stock grew from $2 to $255, triggering a 5-for-1 split.
Using the newly inflated value of their stock, Leghorn started an aggressive diversification effort. In 1960 Leghorn agreed to fund development of a computerized drafting system, EDM, based on the PDP-1 that had earlier been experimented on at MIT. The same year he arranged a merger with Hermes Electronics (originally Hycon Eastern), makers of various military communications systems. This was followed by the 1961 purchase of Photostat Corp., maker of offset printing systems using Kodak patents. In 1962 he lured Gilbert King away from IBM, where he had worked on the Automatic Language Translator and had developed the world's only working optical disc. Meanwhile, work continued on the original archiving system, but the company proved unable to deliver a working product.
Meanwhile, none of Itek's purchases turned into commercial successes, and in 1961 Itek reported a $2,500,000 loss. Its stock began to drop, hitting a low of $9.50. In spite of the CIA's warnings, Rockefeller did little to address Leghorn's problems, which grew out of control. Frustrated by Leghorn ignoring the reconnaissance side of the company in favor of the continuing string of information projects, the engineers revolted and demanded that he be removed. Walkowicz brought in Franklin Lindsay, a former CIA operative, to help Leghorn get the company back on track. This effort backfired, as Leghorn was insulted by the effort and refused to cooperate. In May 1962 Leghorn was pushed out in favor of Lindsay, who became Itek's president and CEO.
With Lindsay at the helm, Itek returned to focusing mostly on reconnaissance efforts, although by this point their photocopying machines were starting to become successful as well. As a side-effect of this newfound focus, Lindsay shed a number of Leghorn's acquisitions. The first to go was the EDM project in 1962, which ironically became a profitable division of Control Data as their Digigraphics system.
By 1964 Lindsay had returned the company to profitability. By this time the CORONA program had overcome its initial failures and had become a success. Itek would eventually deliver about 200 panoramic cameras for the CORONA program. A further success involved the E-5 cameras originally built for the SAMOS project. In 1961 CORONA delivered low-resolution imagery of a new installation that became known as the "Tallinn line". A debate broke out over their significance; some suggested that it was an antiballistic missile installation using the SA-5 Gammon missile, while others pointed out that the resolution was too low to say anything of the sort. A rush effort started at Lockheed to adapt the E-5 camera to the existing CORONA airframe, resulting in the LANYARD project, today known as the KH-6. The project was, generally, a failure. Three satellites were launched, one returning no film and one only blank frames.
Both the CIA and Air Force continued development of new satellite systems, which led to concerns about the proper use of these valuable and expensive resources. These concerns eventually led to the formation of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in 1961, with the overall mission of ensuring that satellite data was distributed properly, and that the satellite time was not wasted, either by photographing the same area twice, or by allowing an area of interest to be photographed by the first available means. Although the Air Force was able to work within the new environment without any apparent problems, creation of the NRO led to serious political infighting with the CIA.
In 1963 Albert "Bud" Wheelon took over from Bissell as the CIA's chief of technology development. Unlike Bissell, who worked almost entirely with outside contractors, Wheelon started internalizing the process and built up a much larger department. In October 1963 he suggested forming the "Satellite Photography Working Group" to study their current efforts and suggest improvements. Under the new agreements, the NRO was supposed to supply funding for the effort, and on 18 November they agreed. In a following experiment the team attempted to determine the optimal resolution for satellite photography, degrading a series of high-quality photographs in stages to see how much information could be pulled from them at different levels of detail. The results strongly suggested building a new satellite with a 2-foot resolution, something what would not be able to be done by improving the existing CORONA system, which offered 10–25 foot resolution. The NRO declined to offer funding for the satellite, however, so Wheelon arranged funding from its own budget and started the "FULCRUM" effort.
When news of the FULCRUM efforts later found their way to the NRO, a major fight broke out that eventually landed on the desk of Robert McNamara. NRO was supposed to be in charge of coordinating development, and was at that point funding development of the Air Force's 18-inch resolution design, KH-7 "GAMBIT". Stung by the outcome, the project suffered a further setback when Itek announced that they would no longer work on FULCRUM's camera because of a demand that they felt was unreasonable, although other sources suggested it was the final result of a long stream of demands and design changes coming from the newly enlarged CIA division. Wheelon retaliated by handing the contract to Perkin-Elmer, which delivered the cameras for what would become the successful KH-9 "HEXAGON", better known as "Big Bird".
There are two different versions of the story of what followed. Richelson states that the NRO quickly handed Itek a contract for their own "S-2" system, a follow-on to the Air Force's troubled SAMOS program. This project had originally selected a Kodak camera, and changed to an Itek design after their FULCRUM announcement. He notes the suggestion that the offer was pre-arranged, in order to deprive the CIA of their camera, and thereby doom the FULCRUM effort. Lewis states that both the FULCRUM and S-2 projects had "already" been handed to Itek, and it was the internal power struggles between the CIA and NRO that led to Wheelon's stream of demands as punishment for accepting the S2 work. Whatever the story, Itek was no longer the CIA's primary supplier after CORONA and LANYARD ended, allowing Perkin-Elmer to become a major supplier. S-2 was later downgraded.
Into this void came a number of different projects. One of these was the KA-80 "Optical Bar Camera" that flew on both the U-2 and SR-71, as well as a further development of the mapping camera from SAMOS/LANYARD that was used on some of the Big Birds. Itek also found a customer for their panoramic cameras with NASA, who used them both on Project Apollo for mapping the lunar surface, as well as Project Viking's Mars landers. Later they built portions of the Keck Telescope and similar projects.
During the same period, Itek's Graphic Systems division, originally supplying the printing systems, had greatly diversified.
In 1982 Litton Industries was attempting to diversify their military holdings, and engaged Lehman Brothers to arrange the purchase of a company specializing in electronic warfare. Lehman found a number of companies that Litton might be interested in, including Itek, presenting a report on 20 September 1982. In October, Litton started purchasing Itek stock in the market in an effort to gain control of about 4.9% of the common shares before making a friendly takeover offer.
On 23 November the chairmen of the two companies met, and by January 1983 the negotiations had progressed to the point of making a formal offer. At the advice of Lehman Brothers, Litton made an offer of the current market price plus a 50% premium. During this period the value of Itek stock was rising, so Litton had to increase their offer on several occasions. On 12 January 1983, Litton made an offer of $48, which succeeded on 4 March 1983. Itek became Litton's Itek Division, although the Itek Graphic Systems division was sold off in 1985.
In 1986 it was revealed that a Lehman Brothers trader had been purchasing Itek stock during the negotiations, part of a wider insider trading scandal. Ira Sokolow, part of the Lehman team arranging the Itek purchase, had leaked information about the deal to another Lehman employee, Dennis Levine. They agreed to make insider trades to drive up the stock price and then split the profits. Levine and other traders at Lehman (either tipped off or simply following Levine's trades) started collecting Itek stock and were thus rewarded with part of the 50% premium when the deal closed.
Litton later sued Lehman, claiming that their purchase would have been at a lower price had the insider trading not occurred. The stock price rose from $26 to $33 during this period, meaning that had the price stayed at $26 a fair offer would have been $39. A lengthy series of court cases followed.
Litton downsized dramatically in the 1990s, selling off many of its components. In 1996 Hughes Electronics purchased what was then left of Itek, Itek Optical Systems in Lexington, MA . At the time they announced that Itek's own facilities in Lexington, Massachusetts would fold it into their own Hughes Danbury Optical Systems in Danbury. Later in the 1990s, after Raytheon's purchase of Hughes, Itek became Raytheon Optical Systems Company. In early 2000, Raytheon divested the Optical Systems group and it was purchased by Goodrich Corporation. Goodrich Corporation was subsequently purchased by United Technologies Corporation headquartered in East Hartford, Connecticut.

Red Hot &amp; Blue (restaurant)

Red Hot & Blue is a Memphis style barbecue restaurant franchise founded by political strategist Lee Atwater and former House of Representatives member Don Sundquist of Memphis, Tennessee, among others.
Red Hot and Blue was founded in 1989 by Atwater, Sundquist, Bob Friedman, Joel Wood, and Wendell Moore, with its first location in Arlington, VA, near Washington, DC. Friedman described the concept of the restaurant as "pigs, pork, and blues" as reflected in the company's logo. The name is taken from the title of DJ Dewey Phillips' radio show which aired on WHBQ-AM in Memphis in the 1950s.
The restaurant was voted Best Barbecue by Leading Consumer Magazine in 2006.
In 1997, the owners of Red Hot and Blue sued Let's Do Barbecue, the parent company of Fat Jack's restaurant of Berlin, New Jersey, alleging unfair trade practices. According to court documents, Let's Do Barbecue's president and CEO Glenn Gross "gained much of his insight into the barbecue business" while an employee of the Cherry Hill, New Jersey Red Hot and Blue. These accusations were found to be untrue during a lengthy court battle with the company.
Red Hot and Blue was served at Washington Nationals games from 2006 through 2008 and is still served at George Mason University basketball games at the Patriot Center.

Toyota Racing Series

The Toyota Racing Series is New Zealand's premier "open-wheeler" motorsport category. The Series includes races for every major trophy in New Zealand circuit racing including the New Zealand Motor Cup and the Denny Hulme Memorial Trophy. The cars are also the category for the New Zealand Grand Prix – one of only two races in the world with FIA approval to use the "Grand Prix" nomenclature outside Formula One.
The Toyota Racing Series is an incubator and showcase for the next generation of New Zealand racing talent. The Series offers emerging drivers the chance to gain valuable experience with carbon-fibre composite chassis, aerodynamics and slick tyres.
The Series has the full endorsement of Motorsport New Zealand, the sport's governing body. The series is managed by Toyota Racing Management a company under the leadership of Barrie Thomlinson.
Previously, the country's leading drivers had to go offshore to step up to this level. High profile graduates from the series to date includes Brendon Hartley, now signed to race Formula Three for the respected Carlin Motorsport team in the UK and Earl Bamber.
For 2008, the series has also gone "green". Fuels for all cars racing in the series are now an E85 biofuel blend of 85 per cent ethanol made from whey, a dairy industry by-product; and petrol. Reduced emissions, reduced carbon "footprint" and reduced use of fossil fuels are all being showcased in this unique New Zealand programme. The 2008 New Zealand Grand Prix thus becomes the first ever biofuel grand prix in the world.
The short summer series (five weekends in five weeks, all in January and February) during the Southern Hemisphere summer has made the series attractive to drivers from the Northern Hemisphere, as the series takes place during the off-season. The 2015 season had a driver from Canada win the championship, and drivers from both Europe and the Americas actively participate in the series, as it allows them to develop their skills during the off-season.
The current championship consists of five rounds, each comprising three races, except Taupo which has four races. For 2016 the circuits are:
Previously used circuits include:
The Toyota Racing Series run a Toyota Tatuus FT-50 with modified versions of 1.8L Toyota four cylinder 2ZZ-GE production engines which can produce 200BHP, a six speed Sadev sequential transmission with limited slip differential with a carbon fibre body and a Carbon monocoque chassis built by Tatuus in Italy to full FIA F3 specification.

Aamir Khan Productions

Aamir Khan Productions (AKP) is an Indian motion picture production and distribution company based in Mumbai. The company was founded in 1999 by actor Aamir Khan; its first production was "Lagaan".
B. Shrinivas Rao is the executive producer for Aamir Khan Productions, and Khan's wife, Kiran Rao, also serves as a producer; she was the associate producer for both "Taare Zameen Par" and "Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na".
Aamir Khan Productions was set up in 1999 by Hindi film actor Aamir Khan with the purpose of producing the film "Lagaan". He decided to produce "Lagaan" after the script was not purchased by any other studio. B. Shrinivas Rao also joined AKP as the line producer on "Lagaan". The movie was released in 2001, with Khan as the lead actor. The film was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Film category along with four other foreign films, eventually losing to "No Man's Land". The film won many major awards at several award functions such as Filmfare and IIFA.
B. Shrinivas Rao later served as the executive producer for Khan's directorial debut, "Taare Zameen Par", and became the executive producer for the production company, supervising all of its productions. Khan also starred in "Taare Zameen Par", sharing the screen with the child actor Darsheel Safary (in his acting debut) and Tisca Chopra. The film was initially conceived of and developed by a husband-and-wife team, Amole Gupte and Deepa Bhatia. It tells the story of a young child who suffers in school until a teacher identifies him as dyslexic. The movie was critically acclaimed. "Taare Zameen Par" won the 2008 Filmfare Best Movie Award as well as a number of other Filmfare and Star Screen Awards. Khan's wife, Kiran Rao, also worked as an associate producer for "Taare Zameen Par".
The third film produced by the company was Abbas Tyrewala's "Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na", released in July 2008. It marked the debut of Aamir Khan and Mansoor Khan's nephew, Imran Khan, and it was co-produced by Ritesh Sidhwani.
The fourth offering from AKP was "Dhobi Ghat" (Mumbai Diaries), a low-budget art house film written and directed by Kiran Rao. It focuses on four characters – one of them played by Khan – from different walks of life in the city of Mumbai.
The next film produced by the production company was Anusha Rizvi's "Peepli Live". This low-budget film was released in August 2010, starring Omkar Das Manikpuri, Raghubir Yadav, Shalini Vatsa, Malaika Shenoy, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and Naseeruddin Shah. It was a satire based on the suicides committed by Indian farmers due to the financial hardship. "Peepli Live" had its premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival on 6 August 2010 at the Regent Theatre, Melbourne.
In 2011, the English/Hindi "Delhi Belly" was released, a departure from the "clean, family entertainment" reputation of Aamir Khan Productions. It was a sleeper hit and immensely popular with urban Indian youth, though it was criticised for strong language.
In 2012, the production company released the suspense drama, "", which starred Khan along with Rani Mukherji and Kareena Kapoor. It was directed by Reema Kagti and was also produced in association with Excel Entertainment. This movie was a semi-hit at the box office.
In 2016, the production company released the sport drama, Dangal, which starred Khan along with Sakshi Tanwar. It was directed by Nitesh Tiwari. Siddharth Roy Kapur has also produced the film.

Eastern Housing Limited

Eastern Housing Limited (EHL)is a public limited company in Bangladesh working in real estate development. The registered office of the company is situated in Bangladesh. Eastern Housing Limited is one of the 29 members of the REHAB Association, the central body for private sector developers in Bangladesh. Eastern Housing Limited (EHL) was established with the objectives of development of land for housing in the urban areas of Dhaka. It is involved in construction, engineering, manufacturing and trading activities. It has been responsible for redefining the environment in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, along with other major developers.
The objectives of the company are as follows:
Eastern Housing Limited (EHL) is a concern of Islam Group of Industries. It was formed in late 1965 under the Chairmanship of Mr. Jahurul Islam (entrepreneur) to reduce the housing problems of Dhaka city. It started its work by successfully implementing a project of building 700 houses in Pallabi Thana, Dhaka, and acquiring of land. It was one of the first to provide low-cost housing to the residents of Bangladesh (then East Pakistan). While the company started operations by developing real estate mostly within Dhaka, the capital of the country, it has started to build outside the city. It regularly takes part in REHAB real estate fairs, both at home and abroad, and experiences sell-out performances. The slogan of Eastern Housing Limited is "Apan Thikana Gore Dey", which translates to "builds your own address".
Engineer Md Akramuzzaman, Director of the Company, took part in the national dialogue on "Strengthening the Role of Private Sector Housing in Bangladesh" organized by Centre for Policy Dialogue in November 2003. In January 2004, the company became a part of the government initiative to build housing for expatriate Bangladeshis in Gulshan Thana, Dhaka. In 2005, Eastern Housing became the highest tax-payer among the 101 real estate developers listed with National Board of Revenue (NBR). On 16 October 2006, RAJUK, the Dhaka City development authority, sent notice about "unauthorized" construction to the Ministry of Housing which included projects of Eastern Housing. Dr. Asaduzzaman, vice chairman of Islam Group, ruled out the possibility of any dubious practices. Some of the real estate developed by Eastern Housing have has faced criticism. The Eastern Tower, an 18-storied apartment block in New Eskaton, Dhaka, is criticized for not installing ample emergency escapes, while the South Banshree project is criticized for getting waterlogged during the monsoon.
Based on the information provided on company website, up to 2008, Eastern Housing Ltd. has sold over of land to its customers in 24 different projects approximating some 13,000 plots. It has also successfully completed over 3,500 units of apartment and has built some modern Shopping Plazas and Commercial Complexes numbering approximating 1500 units. Overall EHL has got more than 40% market share in residential plot and apartment development business in Bangladesh.

Snowcem Paints

Snowcem Paints is a leading manufacturer of exterior cement-based masonry paint in India. Established in Mumbai in 1959,It launched several new products by 2008,and sustained growth of the construction industry in India and the launching of new products has seen the company retain its independence. Currently Amit Sahai, a well known name in ceramic and paint industry has joined the company as executive director and will try to initiate the growth of the company.
Snowcem began manufacturing exterior paints and coatings for the Indian market in 1959, having been established in Mumbai in that year by George Lillington. Snowcem launched the Sandtex brand in 1970, which had strong sales in the European market. In 2002–3 the company was the largest manufacturer of cement paint in India, enjoying between 25–30 per cent of the national market share in this type of powder paint to which water is added, and had attracted the acquisitive attentions of Asian Paints and Berger Paints India. By 2008, however, the company had retained its independence and launched new products to augment its traditional reliance upon cement paint, including external acrylic emulsions and other liquid paints.
Snowcem relies heavily upon the manufacture of water-based paints. Cement paints for application to brickwork, blockwork and concrete are often supplied in the form of fine powder, to which a quantity of water is added immediately before use. After formation in 1959, the products Impermo, Hardcrete, Cemprover, Cemix, Snowfilla and Snowsol were successfully introduced into the Indian market between 1963 and 1969. In the 1970s, Sandtex Matt, an exterior liquid coating in Europe, was launched and met with notable success. Two new products were launched in 1997 - premium quality Snowcryl XT, a pure acrylic base smooth exterior finish and Impermo, an integral cement waterproofing compound, in liquid form.
1999 saw three new products introduced: Uni-gloss, a multi-surface paint system, Trump, a smooth exterior emulsion paint and Snowplast, an acrylic finishing plaster for interiors. In 2008, having avoided acquisition earlier in the decade, Snowcem launched SnowDecor, a range of texture finish products, as well as the acrylic emulsions Snowcryl and Allrounder.
In addition to its manufacturing base in Mumbai, Snowcem has facilities at Gotan, Sinnar near Nashik, and at Gummidipundi near Chennai in Tamil Nadu.

Multiplay

Multiplay (UK) Ltd is a UK-based family company which was incorporated in May 1997 by Craig Fletcher. They have been running gaming events for over a decade. They have achieved mass exposure as the producers of the Insomnia Gaming Festival, the UK's largest video games festival, and as the Events Producer behind Minecon - the "Minecraft" convention held in Disneyland Paris. Multiplay is also known as a worldwide Games Service Provider. Their servers host players from 195 different countries and hold a PCU (Peak Concurrent Users) of over 25,000. The company is owned by Game Digital plc.
Multiplay started as a LAN event organiser in 1999 hosting their first event "Insomnia" in conjunction with Wireplay. The event underwent a name change to i-series for their second event "i2" due to splitting with Wireplay.
Events 2-4 were all hosted in Swindon Town before moving to a new venue, the Newbury Racecourse Conference Center for "i5" in the year 2000. The event later moved to Stoneleigh Park in 2008 for "i34" citing continued growth needing a larger venue. As a result of the recession of 2008 Multiplay were then forced to move back to Newbury Racecourse citing decreased revenue from sponsorships. After 3 years at Newbury the event outgrew the venue again and moved to Telford International Centre in 2011, and it was here that the name of the event was changed back to the original "Insomnia" name. On 2 December 2013 Multiplay announced the Insomnia event would move to the Ricoh Arena for i51 onwards citing continued growth. The event moved again for i56 onwards, this time to the Birmingham NEC, the UK's largest exhibition centre. 
Hundreds of professional gaming tournaments have been hosted at "iSeries" ever since its inception. They offer considerable prize pools for winning tournaments at Insomnia with over £390,000 being given away in prize money. Insomnia attracts major professional gaming teams such as Dignitas, TCM and Infused. In addition to their own tournaments, Multiplay have also been the WCG UK Strategic partner since 2004.
Insomnia Gaming Festival is a large-scale gaming event with a professional Main Stage, an Expo Hall and a large-scale LAN (Local Area Network) event which is the largest LAN in the UK. Originally this was a PC gaming only event, but in recent years has incorporated console gamers. The series of events, referred to as the ‘iSeries’ are sequentially numbered and run three times a year, typically with one around Easter, with the others usually hosted in August and November. The original events were hosted at Newbury Racecourse in the United Kingdom from i5 to i33 when the venue was relocated to Stoneleigh Park for i34. From i38 to i42 the event returned to Newbury. The home of i43 to i50 events was The Telford International Centre and from i51 to i55 it took place at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. i56 - present day is being held at the NEC in Birmingham due to its growth and popularity. These events have evolved with professional competitive tournaments and large exhibition halls. Popular segments of the festival include main stage shows by special guests, often YouTube personalities, as well as evening entertainment such as the "World Famous Insomnia Pub Quiz". Sometimes referred to as “The Glastonbury of Gaming”, Insomnia continues to be the biggest festival of its kind in the UK. The first Insomnia: Insomnia99 was a 300-player event. At that point, it was, and remains, the largest LAN party held in the United Kingdom. It was announced during i55 that the festival would relocate to the NEC in Birmingham in time for i56 in December 2015.
Multiplay were approached by Sandbox/Survival game creators Mojang to produce their fan festival Minecon, celebrating the online world of Minecraft. The convention was held in Disneyland Paris in November 2012 and attracted over 7,000 visitors.
Multiplay UK have also hosted the United Kingdom's national qualifiers for the World Cyber Games at their I-Series events for a number of years, working on behalf of Samsung Electronics UK for the 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 games. For the 2009 games Multiplay have been confirmed as the strategic partner by global organiser International Cyber Marketing. The 2009 UK National Final was held at M Festival, Multiplay's own video gaming festival in August 2009 at Stoneleigh Park.
Multiplay UK’s i44 event in Telford hosted the IGN Pro League 4 UK Qualifiers (IPL 4 UK) resulting in the biggest eSports event the UK has ever hosted. Over 2,500,000 viewers watched the proceedings with TotalBiscuit and Apollo commentating on top Starcraft 2 professional players like White Ra, Stephano and Grubby. $20,000 prize pool was given out to the top 8 players, with the French player Stephano taking gold.
Multiplay also hosted the finals for the ESET UK Masters in 2012/2013 which plays host to the biggest prize pool for a Starcraft 2 tournament sponsored by a UK organization at an esports event (£10,000 per event). This is set to take part for all 3 iSeries events in 2013 making it one of the most ambitious eSports projects hosted within the UK.
At the time of writing, Multiplay host over 23,000 online game servers and are one of the leading GSP’s in the world. Their server projects include hosting official servers for Minecraft, , War of the Roses, Unreal Tournament 3, Natural Selection 2, the Medal of Honor series, the Battlefield series and the main EA forums. Additionally, Multiplay UK holds agreements with companies such as Electronic Arts, Vivendi, Danger Close, Unknown Worlds Entertainment and Paradox Interactive in which they are allowed to host official "ranked" servers for their games. Multiplay also provided the backend infrastructure for the multiplayer features of Respawn Entertainment's "Titanfall 2".
Multiplay also host high availability and high scalability platforms for websites and games, including the entire platform for Eutechnyx’s Auto Club Revolution.

Masimo

Masimo is an American Irvine, California-based manufacturer of noninvasive patient monitoring technologies. The company sells more pulse oximetry to hospitals than any other company. Masimo was founded in 1989 by electrical engineer Joe Kiani, who was later joined by fellow engineer Mohamed Diab. Masimo invented measure-through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry, known as Masimo SET (Signal Extraction Technology). Masimo has been recognized for its intellectual property and for being one of the most innovative companies in the medical device industry. The company went public in 2007 and is currently traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol MASI. In 2011, Forbes named Masimo to its list of top 20 public companies under a billion dollars in revenue, based on earnings growth, sales growth, and return on equity. In 2012, Joe Kiani, founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board was named the Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year - 2012 Life Sciences Award Winner. Kiani was recognized for "revolutionizing the health care industry by taking risks to create and commercialize noninvasive patient monitoring devices, which include an array of sensors that lead to improved accuracy, a reduction in the overall number of false readings, and ultimately, reduced cost of care."
Pulse oximetry uses two light emitting diodes (LEDs), one red and one infrared, to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound with oxygen, which is called arterial oxygen saturation (SpO). Conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving (pulsating) in the measurement site. However, during patient motion, the venous blood also moves, which can cause conventional pulse oximetry to under-read SpO levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood. SET identifies the venous blood signal (which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood), isolates it, and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate SpO and pulse rate. In addition, SET pulse oximetry provides perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI). Multiple studies have shown that compared to non-SET pulse oximeters, SET increases the ability to detect life-threatening events and reduces false alarms during challenging conditions. Additional studies have also shown the impact of SET on patient outcomes, such as helping clinicians:
In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended mandatory screening for all newborns, using "motion-tolerant pulse oximeters that report functional oxygen saturation have been validated in low perfusion conditions". To make this recommendation, the CCHD workgroup relied on two independent studies that exclusively used SET pulse oximetry to assess newborns. In 2012, Masimo received FDA 510(k) clearance for devices and sensors with labeling for screening newborns for CCHD. It marked the first time the FDA cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters, in conjunction with a physical examination, to screen newborns for CCHD.
In 2012, the National Health Service (NHS) Technology Adoption Centre in the United Kingdom advised hospitals to use Intraoperative Fluid Management Technologies as a way to improve patient outcomes, and included Masimo's PVI among technologies available for helping clinicians manage fluid during surgeries. In 2013, the French Society for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care (SFAR) added PVI to its guidelines for optimal hemodynamic management of surgical patients.
rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry uses more than seven wavelengths of light to continuously and noninvasively measure hemoglobin (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), and methemoglobin (SpMet), in addition to oxygen saturation (SpO), pulse rate, perfusion index (Pi), and pleth variability index (PVi). A study at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians decrease the frequency of patients receiving blood transfusions during surgery from 4.5% to 0.6%. Another study from Cairo University showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians reduce blood transfusions in high blood loss surgery by an average of 0.9 units per patient. Emergency department studies have shown that SpCO helps clinicians increase the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and decreases the time to treatment compared to invasive methods. The Pronto-7 device for noninvasive spot checking of hemoglobin, along with SpO and pulse rate, has been recognized with a gold Medical Design Excellence Award. The World Health Organization called noninvasive hemoglobin an "innovative medical technology for cost-effectively addressing global health concerns and needs".
In October 2014, Masimo announced CE Mark of Oxygen Reserve Index or ORi, the company’s 11th noninvasive parameter, which provides real-time visibility to oxygenation status. ORi is intended to supplement, not replace, oxygen saturation (SpO) monitoring and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO) measurements. ORi can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient’s oxygen reserve, and may enable proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia and unintended hyperoxia.
Patient SafetyNet is a remote monitoring and notification system designed for patients on medical/surgical care floors. A large study by Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center showed Patient SafetyNet helped clinicians achieve a 65% reduction in distress codes and rescue activations and a 48% decrease in patient transfers to intensive care units (ICU), yielding a savings of 135 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) days annually for an annual opportunity-cost savings of $1.48 million. ECRI Institute gave Dartmouth its Health Devices Achievement Award for its use of Patient SafetyNet to prevent "severe patient harm". Masimo has introduced Halo Index in the Patient SafetyNet system, combining multiple physiologic parameters into one number to help clinicians assess overall patient status.
Rainbow acoustic monitoring provides noninvasive and continuous measurement of respiration rate using an adhesive sensor with an integrated acoustic transducer that is applied to the patient's neck. Researchers have evaluated acoustic respiration rate (RRa) and found the acceptable accuracy and significantly fewer false alarms than traditional respiration rate monitoring methods, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO) and impedance pneumography.
In 2010, Masimo began offering brain function monitoring to measure the effects of anesthesia and sedation by monitoring both sides of the brain's electrical activity (EEG). Studies have shown this results in more individualized titration and improved care.
In 2012, Masimo began offering ultra-compact mainstream and sidestream capnography as well as multigas analyzers for end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO), nitrous oxide (NO), oxygen (O), and anesthetic agents, for use in the operating room, procedural sedation, and in intensive care units (ICU). A multi-center study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona), and Children's Medical Center (Dallas), found that respiratory rate measured from noninvasive, acoustic monitoring had similar accuracy and precision as nasal capnography, the current standard of care when used in pediatric patients.
On December 1, 2014, Masimo announced FDA 510(k) clearance of Radius-7 for the Root patient monitoring and connectivity platform, the first and only wearable, wireless monitor with Masimo’s rainbow SET technology, enabling early identification of clinical deterioration while offering patients continuous monitoring with freedom of movement. Radius-7 attaches to the patient’s arm or can be placed alongside the patient in their bed, allowing untethered monitoring. Studies have shown that patient mobility is a key factor in more rapid patient recovery.
iSpO pulse oximeter was awarded the Hot Product Award at the 2013 EMS Today Conference & Exposition.
In 2012, Masimo embarked on its first Commitment to Action with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) to solve the global problem of maternal mortality and anemia. The $1 million, two-year project initially focuses on five villages in Liberia and Uganda – two countries where the epidemics of maternal mortality and anemia are among the worst.
In 2013, Masimo founder, Chairman and CEO Joe Kiani, created the nonprofit Patient Safety Movement Foundation with a mission to eliminate the more than 200,000 preventable patient deaths that occur in U.S. hospitals each year. The foundation holds annual Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summits, featuring leaders from healthcare, industry, and government; former President Bill Clinton has served as the keynote speaker.

Levitz Furniture

Levitz Furniture was a nationwide chain of American furniture stores that helped create the "furniture warehouse" genre of retail furniture sales. It was in business for nearly 100 years before liquidating in bankruptcy in early 2008.
The company was founded in Lebanon, Pennsylvania in 1910 by Richard Levitz.
In the 1960s Levitz successfully pioneered selling moderately priced brand-name furniture from a warehouse-style store. It suffered in the 1990s as consumers began to prefer showroom sales that featured spaces arranged to look like actual rooms in houses. 
The chain continued to expand in 2005, when they acquired Seaman's Furniture and Huffman Koos stores after bankruptcy.
The store is known for the slogan and jingle "You'll love it at Levitz."
Levitz was accused of having been poorly run for more than a decade starting in the 1990s. It declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy twice during the period, in 1997 and again in 2005, both times emerging after a corporate restructuring and the participation of new outside backers.
On December 21, 1998, Levitz announced it would close 27 stores and lay off 25% of its workforce. The company downsized its warehouse system from 65 to 17 sites.
The furniture market underwent a prolonged nationwide downturn after the September 11 attacks, and was hurt again in late 2007 by the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis. Levitz filed for bankruptcy the final time in October 2007. As of that time, it was operating nearly 80 stores, mostly in the Northeastern United States and on the West Coast, under the corporation PLVTZ LLC. In October 2008, Levitz Furniture, with bankruptcy court approval, converted its Chapter 11 case to Chapter 7, and started liquidation sales.
The company was sold in bankruptcy to a group of bidders, led by Hilco Merchant Resources, that acted to rapidly liquidate its inventory and close all remaining stores.

Virginia Transformer Corp is the 4th largest power transformer manufacturer in North America. The company supplies custom-made transformers to Power generating and distributing companies, heavy industries and other businesses. The company has 3 manufacturing facilities in North America. The Product range covers a wide range, from larger distribution transformers to large power transformers, rectifier and drive-duty transformers, and special transformers for a wide array of applications. The VTC team has designed transformers to perform at in the mines of Chile's mountains and for the New York City Subway system. However, it also designs generator and substation applications.
Virginia Transformer Corp was established and incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia
in 1971 to supply Power Transformers to the underground mining industry in the nearby Appalachian Mountains. Low profile construction, tough environmental conditions, and other non-standard specifications required for both Dry-type and Liquid-filled Power Transformers in this application started VTC down the road of custom transformer designs and manufacturing.
During the 70's, customer base and product scope became more diversified, adding rectifier duty transformers and reactors for adjustable frequency drive and NEMA R19 extra heavy duty traction applications. Most major urban transit systems today employ transformers built by Virginia Transformer Corp. Later in this decade, VTC also established a predominate reputation for retrofitting the PCB market.
Beginning in the 80's, its current President took the helm at Virginia Transformer Corp and the product range was further expanded to include Industrial and Commercial Power Transformers for distribution applications, including those with automatic load tap changing requirements, and trademarked fully encapsulated coil UNICLAD transformer. This decade saw the beginnings of the 10% - 30% annual growth of VTC, which has been further exceeded in recent years with a continuation of product line expansion into the larger voltage class II sizes of Power Transformers.
The 90's witnessed entry into the demanding Utility market, as customers sought to find additional suppliers for their requirements of high quality and lower cost units. During this decade VTC moved to a new facility and its current corporate headquarters – a custom designed facility for modern transformer manufacturing. Virginia Transformer Corp further expanded by adding a second custom manufacturing facility in Chihuahua, Mexico. This modern operation, designed from the ground up as a transformer plant, has been ISO certified from the beginning.
During the 21st century, Virginia Transformer Corporation continued to grow, acquiring the U S Transformer West facility in Pocatello, Idaho. In addition to this facility building new Medium Voltage class Power Transformers, currently up to 100MVA top rated at 161kV, they also provide reconditioning and repair services to both Utility and Industrial clients. Today, VTC provides individualized solutions and custom designs with Dry-type and Liquid-filled transformers from its three manufacturing facilities in North America. All major components, core and coil assemblies, tanks, etc. are produced on-site with complete testing capabilities up to 950BIL for the complete range of Power Transformers – 300KVA to 300MVA, 230kV class for Utility, Industrial, Commercial, and Export markets.

Dynamit Nobel

Dynamit Nobel AG is a German chemical and weapons company whose headquarters is in Troisdorf. It was founded in 1865 by Alfred Nobel.
After the death of his younger brother Emil in an 1864 nitroglycerin explosion at the family's armaments factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Nobel founded Nitroglycerin AB in Vinterviken, Stockholm. A year later, having found some German business partners, he launched the Alfred Nobel & Company in Germany, building an isolated factory in the Krümmel hills of Geesthacht near Hamburg. This business exported a liquid combination of nitroglycerin and gunpowder known as "Blasting Oil", but it was extremely unstable and difficult to transport, as shown in numerous catastrophes. The buildings of the Krümmel factory itself were destroyed in 1866 and again in 1870.
In April 1866, the company shipped three unmarked crates of nitroglycerin to California for the Central Pacific Railroad, who wished to experiment with its blasting capability to speed the construction of a tunnel through the Sierra Nevada for the First Transcontinental Railroad. One of the crates exploded, destroying a Wells Fargo office in San Francisco and killing fifteen people, leading to a complete ban on the transport of liquid nitroglycerin in California.
Liquid nitroglycerin was widely banned elsewhere as well, and this finally led to Alfred Nobel & Company's development of dynamite in 1867, made by mixing the nitroglycerin with the diatomaceous earth ("kieselguhr") found in the Krümmel hills. Competitors tried to mix nitroglycerin with other inert absorbents in many different combinations to get around Nobel's tightly controlled patents.
Dynamit Nobel AG originates from the company Alfred Nobel & Co., founded on 21 June 1865 in Hamburg by the Swedish chemist and industrialist Alfred Nobel. At the beginning, the company was manufacturing nitroglycerin explosives in the dynamite factory of Krümmel located in Geesthacht, near Hamburg. This factory was the first one to be located outside of Sweden.
Nobel wanted to produce nitroglycerine on several sites in Europe because the transportation of explosives was very dangerous due to its well-known sensitivity to shocks.
Because of the danger associated with handling nitroglycerine, Nobel started to develop a more secure explosive commonly known as dynamite. During the experimental stage, a very severe explosion occurred in 1866 within the Krümmel factory which was nearly destroyed. He was successful in mixing nitroglycerine with kieselgur which made it less sensitive to shocks. In October 1867, Nobel filed a patent for this new explosive in Sweden, the United States of America and in the United Kingdom (the patent was not filed in Germany before 1877). The new explosive was marketed under the name of security powder. In 1874, in order to ensure a better supply of the main buyers, the mines of the region of Ruhr, the company took over the Schlebusch factory in Manfort (since 1930 a district of Leverkusen; Nobel was involved in its construction since 1872 and supervised the production on a temporary basis.
In 1876, Nobel’s company became a limited liability company and was renamed Dynamit AG, i.e. DAG). The company started manufacturing defense equipment, and soon afterwards became the biggest manufacturer of powder and ammunitions of the German Reich.
In 1884, similar to other European countries, the biggest German powder manufacturers agreed to form a cartel (here known as « Interessensgemeinschaft ») named Deutsche Union which was led by Dynamit Nobel for five years. All the largest manufacturers of powder of the German Reich abided by this union which prevented them from competing against each other due to their cooperation and agreement upon the export prices. In 1886, they approached the English powder cartel, the Nobel Dynamite Trust Co and managed to establish the General cartel made up of both the German and English powder factories.
Due to the high demand for defense equipments for the First World War, the manufacturers of powder made very high profits, which were reinforced due to their cartel organisation. Furthermore, during this period, the states strongly encouraged the development and production of weapons.
In 1886, Dynamit Nobel opened a branch in Troisdorf and as from 1905 this factory also manufactured a plastic material based on nitrocellulose (an explosive product): known as celluloid.
Until the start of the First World War, Dynamit Nobel grew by acquiring smaller competitor companies to become the biggest explosive manufacturer in Europe. During the war, it employed prisoners of war in its factory (namely Russian prisoners in the factory of Dömitz).
Without descendants, Alfred Nobel, decided that after his death his fortune would be used to create the Nobel foundation. This was done in 1900. Each year this foundation awards the Nobel Prize. The fortune of Nobel which was converted into shares that finance the Nobel foundation.
After the end of the war, parts of the factory’s facilities were dismantled and after the enforcement of the Versailles treaty, companies were forbidden to manufacture defense equipment. As from then, the company manufactured mostly explosives destined to mines, detonators, ignition systems as well as ammunitions for hunting and sports. The end of the production of the highly profitable defense equipment caused the company to suffer from heavy financial losses. This caused the company to close down some factories while reducing the production capacities in others. In 1923, the company launched the manufacture of plastic parts made of nitrocellulose. Indeed, Dynamit Nobel aimed at reducing its dependence to the defense equipment in order to give more importance to the manufacture of chemical products.
In 1925, the Lindener Zündhütchen- und Thoonwaarenfabrik of Empelde was taken over by the Chemische Werke Lothringen GmbH, which itself belonged to BASF. Production was stopped in 1928 and did not restart until the rearmament which occurred in 1938. During the 1920s, the company collaborated closely with the Siegener Dynamitfabrik AG and the Rheinisch-Westfälischen Sprengstoff-AG which belonged to I.G. Farben since 1931.
In 1926, as a result of the fusion with Köln-Rottweil AG which belonged to "I.G. Farben", Dynamit Nobel was taken over by I.G. Farben. As from then, it formed a cartel with Westfalit AG (the forerunner of the WASAG, which was also taken over by I.G. Farben in 1945), which had a monopolistic position on the German powder market. In 1930, the "Rheinische Spritzguß-Werk GmbH" (today the Dynamit Nobel Kunststoff GmbH) was founded in Cologne. After the national-socialists took lead of the German government, and wished to develop a strong German defense industry, the Wehrmacht explicitly requested bigger ammunition manufacturing capacities. In order to do so, the "WASAG" and Dynamit Nobel founded the Deutsche Sprengchemie GmbH in 1934. New factories manufacturing explosives and ammunitions were built on government lands and received help from a company which had been nationalised, the Verwertungsgesellschaft für Mountain-Industrie mbH.
Afterwards, the Deutsche Sprengchemie GmbH became the only subsidiary of WASAG. Dynamit Nobel had the same activities in Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH (i.e. Verwertchemie). The latter ran more than 30 factories, namely in Liebenau, Empelde, and Stadtallendorf. At that time, Stadtallendorf was the largest place of ammunition production in Europe. During World War Two, more than people coming from camps managed by the SS were forced to work there. In 1938, a new factory manufacturing nitrocellulose was built in Aschau am Inn. After the war it became the property of WASAG due to the decartelisation of I.G. Farben.
After World War Two, Dynamit Nobel began manufacturing plastic equipment and ammunition in West Germany but was not able to keep the factories located in the areas occupied by the Soviets. These factories were partly dismembered. From 1953, Dynamit Nobel tried to develop intermediary organic products in order not to rely completely on the plastic equipment. After deciding the rearmament of Bundeswehr, the manufacture of ammunition was restarted in 1957, at first in the factory of Liebenau by the Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH which had survived the war.
At the beginning of the 1960s, once again, the company became the leader of the military and civil powder market in Germany, namely due to the takeover of the manufacturer of ammunitions Gustav Genschow & Co. AG de Karlsruhe in 1963. At the same time, Dynamit Nobel took an increasing position in the mines market. Since 1958, around 3 million antitank mines, models DM-11 were manufactured in Liebenau under licence of the Swedish company LIAB. Moreover, in collaboration with Bölkow and Dornier, Dynamit Nobel participated to the research projects of the Ministry of nuclear energy (today known as the Federal Ministry of education and research) for the possible supply of Germany with missiles.
During the end of the 1950s, Friedrich Karl Flick, who was a board member of the supervisory board before the war, started to monopolise the company to the detriment of the minority shareholders, sometimes by brutal means. Supported by the Bremen speculator Hermann Krages and partly due to the collusive trading of actions with the Feldmühle AG of which Flick was also a shareholder, he managed to obtain the majority of the shares of the company and became the president of the board of directors. As from then, Flick who already possessed 82% of the share capital, made use of the controversial "Umwandlungssteuergesetzes" (fiscal law regarding commercial companies) in order to squeeze out the minority shareholders of the company, in exchange of a compensation (this tool is comparable to the one used today in order to exclude minority shareholders out of a company). After several groups of shareholders protested against this law put into place under the third Reich, the Federal Constitutional Tribunal gave a judgement in favour of Flick.
In 1959, Dynamit AG changed its name to Dynamit Nobel AG, in remembrance of its famous founder. As from 1962, due to the pressure which occurred during the conference, the company which belonged to Flick started to negotiate the compensation to be given to forced Jewish employees who worked in the factory of Troisdorf in 1944 and 1955. After an agreement was made, Friedrich Flick personally blocked the payment of five million Deutsche Mark and no sum of money was released until his death in 1972. In January 1970, Flick made a final statement and declared that he He affirmed that a payment would contradict his previous statements of innocence at the Flick trial and he was unwilling to make a payment to be considered as an admission of guilt. He also affirmed that the Swiss Dieter Bührle (Oerlikon-Bührle) was also a shareholder of Dynamit Nobel, being the owner of 18% of the shares.
After Bundeswehr was fully equipped with antitank mines during the late 1960s, the factory of Liebenau was sold in 1977 to the Dutch ammunitions manufacturer Eurometaal, owned by Dynamit Nobel (33% of shares). As from then, the big mines projects were put into place in Troisdorf and in Burbach-Würgendorf.
In 1986, the Flick group was bought by Deutsche Bank for an approximate amount of 5.36 billions of DM. The latter restructured the group and sold parts of it while putting the rest of the group on the stock market. Deutsche Bank finally agreed to compensate the forced workers of "Dynamit Nobel AG" in respect of the conditions established in the 1960s. During the restructuring of Dynamit Nobel A, G a joint-venture was made with two of the companies of the Flick Group, namely Feldmühle AG and Buderus AG and was renamed Feldmühle Nobel AG. In 1986, the new group was introduced on the stock market. In 1988, the grand children of Friedrich Flick (Friedrich Christian Flick and his brother Gert Rudolf Flick) failed to gain control over the Feldmühle Nobel AG. Indeed, in 1992, Metallgesellschaft AG (today known as the GEA Group) took over the company to fraction it again. Shares of Dynamit Nobel AG and Buderus remained the property of Metallgesellschaft, while the pulp and paper division (formerly known as Feldmühle AG) was sold under the name of Feldmühle Nobel AG to the Swedish company Stora (Stora Enso since 1998).
As early as 1988, Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH, which had been managed as an affiliate, and Dynamit Nobel put into force an agreement regarding the consolidation and profit transfer In 1990, the subsidiary was merged with another subsidiary, Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff- und Systemtechnik GmbH.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the company was present in the basic and intermediary chemical products, synthetic fibres, specific chemical products (such as silicon wafers) and the processing of plastic materials (in particular PVC). About one quarter of the turnover of the company originated from the traditional sector of explosives, as well as the ammunition technology which is closely linked to the equipment projects of the Bundeswehr.
In 1992, the company took over "Cerasiv GmbH" and Chemetall GmbH, and in 1994 "Sachtleben Chemie GmbH" and Chemson GmbH were also taken over. In 1996, the company acquired "CeramTec AG" which belonged to Hoechst and merged with Cerasiv GmbH under the name of CeramTec Innovative Ceramic Engineering AG.
In 1997, Dynamit Nobel took over Phoenix Kunststoff GmbH in order to reinforce its position in the plastic equipments market. In 1999, Dynamit Nobel and the chemical company Solvadis were united within the MG chemical group. The scope of chemical activities within Chemetall was optimized by the acquisition of C"yprus Foote" (1998) and "Brent" (1999), followed by the sale of two subsidiaries namely, "Chemson GmbH" (1999) et "Coventya GmbH" (2000).
In 2001, the industrial activities of "Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff und Systemtechnik GmbH" was taken over by Orica. In 2002, the Swiss group RUAG technology took over "Dynamit Nobel Ammotec GmbH", which had been separated from "Dynamit Nobel Explosivstoff und Systemtechnik GmbH". In this company, the production was focussed on the manufacture of ammunitions of small calibre.
In 2004, "MG technologies AG" sold its chemical activities to emphasise the manufacture of equipment. Therefore, Dynamit Nobel AG was dismantled and taken over by several companies. The American company "Rockwood Specialties Group Inc", the largest buyer, acquired "Sachtleben Chemie GmbH", "Chemetall GmbH", "CeramTec Innovative Ceramic Engineering AG" and "DNSC GmbH" as of 31 July 2004 for 2.25 billions of euros through its Luxemburg subsidiary Knight Lux 1 S.A.R.L.. Part of DNSC GmbH remains in Leverkusen and is known as "Dynamit Nobel GmbH ES."
"Rockwood" is a chemical holding company that the financial investor company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co had acquired. D"ynamit Nobel Kunststoff GmbH" was taken over in 2004 by the Swedish company "Plastal Holding AB" for 915 million euros.
The technical armament activity was reduced under the name of Dynamit Nobel Defence GmbH, with the registered office located in Würgendorf (Burbach). The company was specialised in the manufacture of small calibres for the army, official authorities, hunters and shooting sports and was taken over by the Swiss group "RUAG" in 2002 and merged with its ammunitions branch. Therefore, the former companies "Dynamit Nobel Marken RWS", "Rottweil" and "Geco" were named "RUAG Ammotec GmbH" (Fürth).
The dismantlement of the Nobel group was made in close collaboration with the employees representatives, who were highly involved during the sales negotiations. Indisputably the employees’ committee would have preferred that the chemical activity remains within "MG technologies AG", but an agreement was reached as Rockwood Inc. certified that the long term interests of the company would be maintained and that all the German employees would keep their jobs.
As from 1958, Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH/Verwertchemie, a subsidiary of "Dynamit Nobel" manufactured antitank mines of type DM-11 in Liebenau, under licence of the Swedish company "LIAB".
The antitank mines AT-2 were created by Dynamit Nobel and approximately 1.3 millions were manufactured. Bundeswehr ordered of them for the LARS (a system of light artillery with missiles) which was into place until 2000, about were manufactured for Minenwurfsystem Skorpion (a vehicle which installed mines) and for M270 (a multiple rocket launcher).
Between 1981 and 1986, Bundeswehr invested 564.7 millions of DM in mines projects, . Besides the antitank mines AT-2, Dynamit Nobel developed an antipersonnel mine AP-2, an anti-material mine, a signal mine and a shallow water mine.
HK G11, a new assault rifle using an ammunition without casing was developed in collaboration with the weapons manufacturer "Heckler & Koch" between 1968 and 1990, whereas "Dynamit Nobel" developed the ammunitions without casing. The project was completed but the Bundeswehr declined it due to financial considerations.
Dynamit Nobel marketed the Swedish antitank mine FFV 028SN of the company "FFV" and took charge of the transformation of 125 000 antipersonnel mines, model DM-31 which had been manufactured between 1962 and 1967 by Industriewerke Karlsruhe (today KUKA) which belonged to the Quandt group at the time, in order to enable them to conform to the antitank mines authorised by the Ottawa convention. However, the detonator was not sufficiently modified, and it could therefore be used against people, while it should only have been used against tanks.
In respect of an agreement made in 1989, Dynamit Nobel was manufacturing blank cartridge bullets and figure targets in Würgendorf. Dynamit Nobel also agreed to develop the Panzerfaust 3, in order to progressively deliver it to the Bundeswehr and other armies as the priority antitank defence mechanism in the infantry. In 2010, several different types are manufactured for the Bundeswehr.
"Dynamit Nobel AG" and its successor "Dynamit Nobel Defense GmbH" were often criticised for their production of mine systems. Since the creation of the Bundeswehr the company has delivered 3.2 millions land mines. In 1992 the company advertised using the tag line "Dynamit Nobel — the first address for mines" in industry magazines.
The Bundeswehr still uses antitank mines manufactured by Dynamit Nobel, which are supposedly able to be used against people as well, in a manner prohibited by the Ottawa convention.
Until the 1970s, Dynamit Nobel polymerised the monomer vinyl chloride into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the factory of Troisdorf. At this time, about 130 to 140 employees were regularly in touch with it. In total, about 3600 persons have worked within this division since the launching of the production in Troisdorf in the 1940s.
Infringing the health and safety regulations in force at that time, the employees of Dynamit Nobel were exposed for years, with little protection, to this harmful substance which later turned out to be carcinogenic. Therefore, they were heavily contaminated by vinyl chloride gas or by cleaning up the autoclaves. At this time, most of the other manufacturers of PVC had already put into place systems of production, which were less dangerous for the health. The same has not been done in Dynamit Nobel because of financial considerations. Moreover, regular controls were not made, others were partially manipulated or the results were kept secret. Also, the company made an important contribution to the region, regularly obtained extensions of time to apply the regulations. Contamination due to vinyl chloride was so severe that for years in the company, the employees complained of damages relating to their liver, anemia, finger circulation disorder resulting in acro-osteolysis (necrosis of the first phalanxes), as well as headaches and dizziness. Cancers also resulted from the exposure.
After the announcement of the first thirteen severe diseases during spring 1972, work inspectors from Bonn ordered Dynamit Nobel to take the appropriate measures in order to improve the health and safety conditions of work. But the company took a long time to put them into place.
Afterwards, the 40 sick employees gathered together as Interessengemeinschaft der VC-Geschädigten in order to file a complaint for violation of duty against the Land of North-Rhine-Westphalia and asked for damage compensation, just like in the Contergan trial. The local committee of the DKP in Troisdorf filed a complaint for injury and involuntary homicides against the board of directors of Dynamit Nobel AG. Both complaints remained unsuccessful. After more details about the scandal were made public, employees and inhabitants of Troisforf organised a series of demonstrations. In 1975, the company’s board of directors decided to shut down PVC polymerisation workshop to escape the expensive costs related to modernization and security of the plant.
Since the first announcement about the existing risks, the company has tried its best to keep things quiet. In that respect, it has put a lot of pressure on the journalists and editors. During the following years, some employees were contaminated and died due to their disease without the company ever compensating them.

Franchise Pictures

Franchise Pictures LLC was an independent motion picture production and distribution company with Warner Bros. Entertainment, founded by Elie Samaha and Andrew Stevens. They were known for their production in the action film genre. The company also had a short-lived video game arm, Franchise Interactive.
As of 2009, the Franchise Pictures library, along with that of ThinkFilm, is now owned by Orange Holdings LLC. The Franchise Library is currently distributed worldwide by Revolution Studios through Park Circus.
Franchise Pictures is mostly known for its reputation on several films that received mostly negative reviews. Both "Battlefield Earth" and "" were universally panned and are considered to be two of the worst films of all time. However a few of their films ("The Boondock Saints" and "The Whole Nine Yards" for example) have garnered a strong cult following.
Following the financial failure of "Battlefield Earth" and other films independently produced by Franchise Pictures, "The Wall Street Journal" reported that the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing "the question of whether some independent motion picture companies have vastly inflated the budget of films in an effort to scam investors". In December 2000 the German-based Intertainment AG filed a lawsuit alleging that Franchise Pictures had fraudulently inflated budgets in films including "Battlefield Earth", which Intertainment had helped to finance. Intertainment had agreed to pay 47% of the production costs of several films in exchange for European distribution rights, but ended up paying for between 60% and 90% of the costs instead. The company alleged that Franchise had defrauded it to the tune of over $75 million by systematically submitting "grossly fraudulent and inflated budgets".
The case was heard before a jury in a Los Angeles federal courtroom in May–June 2004. The court heard testimony from Intertainment that according to Franchise's bank records the real cost of "Battlefield Earth" was only $44 million, not the $75 million declared by Franchise. The remaining $31 million had been fraudulent "padding". Intertainment's head Barry Baeres told the court that he had only funded "Battlefield Earth" because it was packaged as a slate that included two more commercially attractive films, the Wesley Snipes vehicle "The Art of War" and the Bruce Willis comedy "The Whole Nine Yards". Baeres testified that "Mr. Samaha said, 'If you want the other two pictures, you have to take "Battlefield Earth"—it's called packaging'". Baeres commented: "We would have been quite happy if he had killed "Battlefield Earth"".
Intertainment won the case and was awarded $121.7 million in damages, of which Samaha himself was declared by the court to be personally liable for $77 million in damages. However, the jury rejected Intertainment's claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, which would have trebled the damages if Franchise had been found liable on that charge. Samaha vowed to appeal but the fraud judgment destroyed Franchise's viability; the company and its subsidiaries all filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions on August 19, 2007.

47.2% of IGCSE grades (10-11) achieved by Nord Anglia Education students were the highest levels of A* or A, which is double the 2015 UK average of 21.2%.
The percentage of students achieving 5A*-C grades, including English and Math at IGCSE is 83.1%, outperforming the UK average of 52.6%.
Nord Anglia Education students have outperformed the IB global average in the last five years. Students' scores on the IB Diploma averaged 33.5, compared to the 2015 global average of 29.9 points. 12.5% of students scored 40 points and above.
Nord Anglia students are connected through Global Campus, an initiative which uses online communities to connect students with their international counterparts. This helps students develop a global perspective and a network of friends around the world. The program offers a wide range of activities undertaken in school, online or at destinations around the world.
In February 2015, Nord Anglia Education and The Juilliard School announced a global collaboration to enhance performing arts education for students in grades K-12. The program includes an embedded curriculum along with continued support and engagement with Juilliard alumni and affiliated artists. It also includes professional development for teachers, a summer school and private lessons. The curriculum was rolled out in September 2015 and is expected to educate more than 20,000 students aged 3 to 18 by 2017.
The curriculum focuses on key works of music, dance and drama.
CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, has criticized today's education for focusing too much on league tables and wants to "inspire children to engage with all their studies and develop a love of learning" through the Juilliard collaboration.
In 2015, Nord Anglia partnered with King's College London to offer an Executive Master's in International Education. Courses are designed specifically to address challenges specific to international schools. The program is fully funded by Nord Anglia Education and available only to Nord Anglia Education teachers. Nord Anglia and King's College London states that the program will open up to teachers outside Nord Anglia schools in 2020. Fifty teachers will start the program in 2016. The aim of the program is to recruit, develop and retain high quality teachers. The program is a two-year, part-time masters program which is designed to teach effective leadership skills and feature online face-to-face modules.
In May 2016, Nord Anglia Education announced a global collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on STEAM subjects for K-12 students. The collaboration will develop a new approach to implement science, technology, engineering, visual arts, and mathematics program across 42 Nord Anglia schools worldwide. Core to the collaboration is the reflection of MIT's philosophy of 'Mens et Manus', 'mind and hand', which calls for a hands-on approach to problem solving. Students will learn directly from lecturers and students at MIT.STEAM discipline teachers at Nord Anglia will also benefit from unique professional development opportunities through annual workshops and ongoing training with MIT staff, hosted by the MIT Museum The CEO of Nord Anglia Education, Andrew Fitzmaurice, said that the collaboration with MIT is intended to help students build skills for the 21st century. He has also said that subjects traditionally taught in school do not necessarily give the knowledge and skills needed in an ever-changing world and the greatest discoveries in our century exist at the cross-section of subjects, citing MIT's groundbreaking cancer research using nanotechnology to destroy cancer cells.
Roughly 63% of the total student body of all Nord Anglia Education schools combined are from expat families. The remaining 37% of the student body come from local families.
One in three Nord Anglia graduates in 2015 was accepted to one of the top 100 universities in the world as ranked by the QS World University Rankings.
Its head office is Central, Hong Kong. It has offices in Oxford and London in the UK.
It was previously headquartered in the Anglia House in Cheadle, Greater Manchester; and later in the Nord House in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire (the Cheadle office at the time housed the International Schools and Learning Services divisions).
Nord Anglia Education also runs Nord Anglia University, an online platform that connects all teachers from across all 42 schools to share teaching methods, experiences and advice. The platform provides online seminars, webinars, and resources so that teachers can continue their professional and career development. Nord Anglia Education appeals to many teachers seeking international education experience. In January 2015, the organization received 9,300 applications for 280 positions.
In addition to general classrooms, all Nord Anglia schools are equipped with specialist facilities including for sports, arts and science. Many schools are outfitted with a swimming pool, library and computer lab. Currently, seven schools offer boarding options:
La Côte International School (Aubonne)
Collège du Léman (Geneva)
Collège Beau Soleil (Villars-sur-Ollon)
Collège Champittet (Lausanne)
Regents International School Pattaya
St Andrews International School Bangkok
Windermere Preparatory School (Windermere, Florida)
The Village School (Houston, Texas)
North Broward Preparatory School (Coconut Creek, Florida)
Nord Anglia Education operates eight schools in mainly Tier 1 cities in China such as Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. They also operate a K-11 school in Chengdu, Sichuan province.
All Nord Anglia Education schools in China use English as the primary language of instruction. Each student receives four lessons in Mandarin Chinese a week, except in Hong Kong where this is optional. Students reach a proficient level in Mandarin Chinese by the time they leave.
Nord Anglia Education schools in China are among the first to receive the new Juilliard-Nord Anglia Performing Arts program in their schools thanks to the growing demand in the region for the institute.
Nord Anglia Education operates eight schools throughout Southeast Asia in Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand.
Nord Anglia Education operates six schools in Qatar and the UAE. The majority of students are from expat families working in the region's oil industry.
Nord Anglia Education operates twelve schools in North America. One school is located in Monterrey, Mexico, while the remaining eleven schools are in the United States.
Nord Anglia Education operates ten schools in Europe. The majority of schools are in Switzerland, but they also operate schools in Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Spain.

NetSuite

NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg as NetLedger, web-hosted accounting software. Oracle licensed the software under the banner of The Oracle Small Business Suite for a short time before that was cancelled. Goldberg is current chairman and chief technology officer.
On January 4, 2007, NetSuite named "Moneyball" General Manager Billy Beane of Major League Baseball's Oakland A's to its board of directors. Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.
NetSuite became a publicly traded company after its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2007. Though NetSuite has shown a 149% increase in revenue in the five-year period from 2009 to 2014 it has incurred annual operating losses since inception.
NetSuite had 2,550 employees as of March 31, 2014, a 31% increase over March 31, 2013, when it had 1,953. One quarter of its employees are based in its Philippine office. NetSuite has additional offices in Denver, Las Vegas, Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Toronto, the UK, Spain, the Czech Republic, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Uruguay.
On July 28, 2016, Oracle announced it had offered to purchase NetSuite for $9.3 billion USD. The deal faces intense scrutiny because Oracle founder, Larry Ellison, owns nearly 40% of NetSuite. This conflict of interest has led the board of both companies to establish independent committees to review the deal from the perspective of independent shareholders. Some major NetSuite shareholders, such as T. Rowe, have notified Oracle they will not be tendering their shares under the current terms of the proposed deal. In early October 2016, Oracle extended the deadline for shareholders of NetSuite to tender their shares to November 4.
Even prior to the July 28, 2016 announcement that Oracle Corporation would acquire NetSuite Inc., the two firms shared a close relationship.
In 1998 Evan Goldberg received approximately $125 million in initial financial backing from Larry Ellison, founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation through Ellison's venture capital entity Tako Ventures. Other initial investors were StarVest Partners ADP and UBS PaineWebber. The NetSuite software also relies on database software licensed from Oracle.
Ellison and family members own approximately 47.4% of NetSuite's common stock as of December 31, 2014. The firm's 10-Q filing on March 2, 2015, states that "Mr. Ellison is able to exercise control over approval of significant corporate transactions, including a change of control or liquidation."

Shipyard named after 61 Communards

Shipyard named after 61 Communards ( "61 Kommunar yard") is a major shipyard located in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. In modern times, the shipyard has been most commonly referred to as Nikolaev North Shipyard.
In 1788, the Nikolaev Admiralty shipyard was founded on the banks of the Ingul river approximately inland from the Black Sea. The following year the first 44-gun frigate, "St. Nicholas", was launched. In 1851, Admiral M.P. Lazarev ordered the first considerable reconstruction of the shipyard.
In 1910 the government decided to stop building battleships and close the shipyard, but it was reopened in the following year as the French-owned Russian Shipbuilding Corporation (Russud). The name "Russud" comes from combining the word "Russian" and the word "Sudostroitel'nyj" (lit. "Shipbuilding").
Between 1911 and 1914, two building berths with slip-ways, an assembling and welding workshop, a number of buildings and an outfitting wharf were built on the left bank of the Ingul River.
Early in the Soviet era, the shipyard was renamed to the "Andre Marti (North) Yard". In 1931, the shipyard was named after 61 Communards. From then on, torpedo-boats, destroyers, light cruisers, submarines; naval supply vessels, including rescue vessels of various purposes equipped with deep-water operation systems were built. It was named Shipyard No. 200 (in the name of 61 Communards) on 30 December 1936 and was renumbered as Shipyard No. 445 when it reopened after the end of World War I.
The shipyard is about , with a building area of about . Production capacities of the shipyard are concentrated in 286 industrial buildings and 165 industrial structures.
The following vessels were constructed at this shipyard. The list is not all inclusive.

ExAblate

Exablate is a family of non-invasive medical devices manufactured by Insightec, a company headquartered in Haifa, Israel with regional offices in USA (Dallas, Texas), China, Japan and Europe. The Exablate and Exablate Neuro use MRI-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) technology, which combines focused ultrasound with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Focused ultrasound is capable of ablating tissue inside the body without the need for an incision. The MRI is used to visualize anatomy, aid in planning the treatment and monitoring temperatures in real-time during the treatment. This thermal feedback allows the physician to control and adjust the treatment in real-time to ensure that the targeted tissue is completely ablated without impacting adjacent healthy tissue.
Ultrasound is a form of energy that passes through skin, muscle, fat and other soft tissue. Low intensity ultrasound waves have been safely used for years in diagnostic imaging devices. With higher energy levels, ultrasound waves can generate enough heat to cause thermal ablation, which destroys cells.
With focused ultrasound, the ultrasound waves are directed from a transducer (which converts electrical energy into ultrasound energy) to a focal target. The ultrasound beams pass through soft tissue and only at the focal point where they converge is heat generated. The therapeutic effect is created by raising the tissue temperature during energy delivery (sonication) which causes thermal ablation and defined regions of protein denaturation, irreversible cell damage and coagulative necrosis at the target. The accuracy of MRgFUS enables physicians to effectively treat tumors and other tissue without damaging surrounding tissue or structures. Cells as close as 0.1 mm from the target remain undamaged. A treatment consist of multiple exposures of focused energy or sonications.
Magnetic resonance imaging provides high resolution visualization, patient-specific treatment planning and continuous monitoring of the Exablate procedure. MR images are acquired in 3 orientations (coronal, axial, and sagittal) to give the user a complete anatomical survey of the treatment area. Targeted tissue and surrounding structures such as intestine or nerves are clearly visible on MR images. The images are used for treatment planning and to assist the treatment team in proper positioning of the patient on the treatment bed.
Temperature maps display the relative tissue temperature as a color map superimposed on an anatomical MR image. This allows the physician to observe temperature changes in real-time during treatment. Based on these observed temperature changes, treatment parameters can be adjusted to ensure that the targeted tissue is completely ablated without impacting adjacent healthy tissue.
T1 weighted MR images with Gadolinium contrast acquired post-treatment enable the physician to immediately assess the treatment outcome and verify complete ablation.
Exablate Neuro was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July, 2016 to treat essential tremor in patients who have not responded to medication. The device received Health Canada and KFDA approval for the same indication and CE mark for essential tremor, tremor dominant Parkinson’s disease and neuropathic pain.
Exablate was approved by the FDA for the ablation of uterine fibroids including for women who desire to retain fertility and spare their uterus and received CE mark for the ablation of soft tissue for treatment of benign tumors, including uterine fibroids and adenomyosis. As of 2016, over 14000 uterine fibroid treatments have been performed worldwide.
Exablate has FDA approval for the pain palliation of metastatic bone cancer in patients for whom radiation therapy is not an alternative and CE Mark for pain palliation of painful bone metastases and local treatment of cancerous and benign primary and secondary bone tumors.
In the US, Exablate is approved for the following applications:
In Europe, the Exablate is being used to treat the following:
The Exablate treatment for uterine fibroids (reference) is an FDA approved outpatient procedure. Patients arrive at the treatment location generally one hour prior to the procedure for pre-treatment preparation which includes: a pregnancy test to ensure that the patient was not pregnant, shaving and cleaning the patient’s abdomen to ensure acoustic coupling, and introduction of IV. Conscious sedation (fentanyl, Midazolam, Toradol) is used during the treatment as needed.
Patients are positioned in a prone position on the ExAblate table, and T2 weighted MRI scans of the pelvic region are initially taken to plan the treatment. A region of treatment is drawn directly on the MRI images using the ExAblate software, indicating the volume of fibroid to be treated. LEDRs (Limited Energy Density Regions), which are used to mark regions that are not intended for treatment (such as bowel and bone) are also placed on the images to ensure safety of treatment. Then, a test sonication (single delivery of focused ultrasound energy) using a sub-lethal dose is administered to ensure the system is properly calibrated prior to initiating treatment.
The treatment consists of multiple sonications each approximately the size of a small jelly bean. The number of sonications and hence the duration of treatment depends on the size of the tumor to be treated. The energy delivered with each sonication is capable of raising the temperature of the tissue upwards of 65 degrees Celsius resulting in coagulative necrosis. During each sonication, real-time thermal images generated from the MRI are used to ensure sonication accuracy and confirm that sufficient dose has been delivered. In the event of severe pain or heating at any time during the delivery of energy, the patient can stop the sonication by pressing a handheld button.
At the end of the procedure, a gadolinium contrast agent is administered and T1w post-contrast MRI scans are performed. These images are used to verify complete ablation. For uterine fibroids, the images determine the NPV (Non-Perfused Volume) of the fibroid, which is the volume of tissue that is non-viable (has no blood flow to it). The NPV ratio of a fibroid is defined as the non-perfused tissue volume measured by the T1w post contrast scans, divided by the fibroid volume measured by the T2w images pre treatment.
The Exablate system consists of the following components:

<doc id="15052299" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15052299" title="Randall Amplifiers">
Randall Amplifiers

Randall Amplifiers is a manufacturer of guitar amplifiers, a subsidiary of U.S. Music Corporation. Its products have been used by artists such as Kirk Hammett of Metallica, Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, George Lynch, Scott Ian of Anthrax, Nuno Bettencourt of Extreme, Chuck Schuldiner of Death, Ty Tabor of King's X, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, and Ola Englund of Six Feet Under and Feared. Randall makes both solid-state and tube amplifiers.
The Randall Amplifier Company was founded in 1970 by Don Randall, a lifelong radio and audio amplifier enthusiast. Randall began working as a salesman for a radio supply shop after graduating from community college in Santa Ana, California. It was there that he began a business relationship with Leo Fender, who at the time was operating a nearby radio repair shop. Randall went on to serve in the Army Corps of Engineers, the Signal Corps and Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, he took a job as general manager of Radio & Television Equipment, a wholesale distributor of electronic components, where he discovered that Fender had begun making a few lap steel guitars and small amplifiers in his shop on what is now Harbor Boulevard in Fullerton, California.
Fender was anxious to expand his business, and was receptive when in 1946 Randall suggested that Radio & Television Equipment distribute his guitars and amps. In February 1953, Fender Sales Corporation and Fender Electric Instrument Company were established. Randall, in charge of sales and distribution, was responsible for naming most of the classic Fender products which included the Broadcaster (which later became the Telecaster) and the Stratocaster. Randall subsequently became vice president and general manager of the Fender Musical Instrument and Fender Sales divisions of CBS.
In 1969, Randall left to found Randall Amplifiers. Randall Amplifiers was founded in 1970 in Irvine, California. Randall sold the company in 1987. In the mid-1990s, it was purchased by U.S. Music Corporation.
In the early 2000s, the company worked with Bruce Egnater of Egnater Amplification to create the MTS (Modular Tube System) series of guitar amplifiers. These involve a single amp head consisting of the power amp and part of a preamp, and slots in the head (one for the RM20 head and combo, two for the RM50 head and combo and RM22 head, and 3 for the RM100 head and RM100C combo, and 12 for the RM1250H) in which you can insert their various preamp modules. These modules are tube preamps in themselves that model various amps, from Vox and Fender style cleans, to Marshall crunch, to all out Mesa Boogie style distortion.
This series also has a rack-mount preamp unit called the RM4 that can hold up to four preamp modules at once.
George Lynch, Kirk Hammett, and Scott Ian have their own signature modules and RM100 heads. The heads both have unique cosmetic differences, and some tonal difference. The only tonal difference in the three modular heads is that George Lynch's Lynch Box RM100LB comes loaded with JJ E34L power tubes, Scott Ian's RM100SI comes loaded with JJ EL34 power tubes, and Kirk Hammet's RM100KH has added depth in the power section for more bottom end than the standard RM100 head.
It was hinted and confirmed during Winter NAMM 2012 that the MTS line of amplifiers would be discontinued and that Egnater would take over the line.
In April 2012, Randall confirmed that the MTS amplifiers were discontinued and would be replaced by a new, high-end line of amplifiers.
In December 2011, it was announced by the head of Fortin Amplification, Inc. that they would be teaming up with Randall amplifiers to design a new tube amp line based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. Endorsee Kirk Hammett currently has four of the prototypes, one which he used for the Big 4 show at Yankee Stadium and concerts in India. It was also announced that they will be addressing their current amplifier line, both solid state and tube.
In April 2012, Randall Amplification introduced Mike Fortin as an exclusive design engineer for Randall Amplification. As the founder of Fortin Amplification, Inc. he has forged a worldwide reputation for creating cutting edge high gain amplifier designs. His first priorities will be a new multi-channel, 150 watt Kirk Hammett Signature Model Head and a whole range of high end, high gain all tube amplifiers to be manufactured in North America. The new Fortin designed series of Randall amplifiers will replace the discontinued MTS Series.
The collaboration produced a series high gain tube amplifiers such as the 667 and the Thrasher and several signature models. In addition to the Kirk Hammett signature models, Randall released the Ultimate Nullifier EN 120, a signature amp for Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian in 2014. Randall and Fortin also collaborated with The Haunted guitarist Ola Englund and designed a signature amp based on Englund's Fortin 'Natas' amplifier called 'Satan'.
On January 1, 2016, Fortin announced his partnership with Randall had ended the previous day, and he would not be renewing his contract.
In 2014, the Fortin designed flagship 6 channel model 667 head was announced. Additionally, Randall entered the pedal market with the RG13 1 Watt, 3 channel amp/pedal, the Facepunch overdrive, MOR boost pedal, RGOD preamp pedal and RF8 8 button midi pedal.

Elmendorf Farm

Elmendorf Farm was a Kentucky Thoroughbred horse farm in Fayette County, Kentucky, involved with horse racing since the 19th century. Once the North Elkhorn Farm, many owners and tenants have occupied the area, even during the American Civil War. Most of the land has since been sold off or leased to neighboring stud farms.
In about 1806, Robert Carter Harrison (1765–1840) brought his wife Ann Cabell Harrison (1771–1840) and their many children from their home in Clifton, Virginia, to Fayette County, Kentucky. There he bought the Old Kenney Farm, also known as Elk Hill, and later built his home, which came to be known as "Clifton". Elizabeth M. Simpson's book (See Ref) says the frame colonial style house was built prior to 1830; while Joe Jordon's book (See Ref) says it was built between 1835 and 1840.
Robert's son, Carter (1796–1825) died before his father, so in 1840 "Clifton" passed to Robert's grandson Carter Harrison, Sr. (1825–1893), jointly with the child's mother Caroline Evaline (Russell) Carter (1797–1875). Caroline was the daughter of Colonel William Russell. Carter Henry Harrison, Sr. (1825–1893) sold "Clifton" in 1855 after his mother, Caroline, was remarried to Reverend Thomas Parker Dudley of Lexington, brother of noted surgeon Benjamin Winslow Dudley. Carter moved to Chicago where he served four consecutive terms as mayor (1879–1887) and was re-elected for a fifth term in 1893.
On October 30, 1893, Harrison was assassinated in his own home. The Maysville, Kentucky "Evening Bulletin" headline said he was "Shot by a Crank". Harrison died and was buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. His son Carter Harrison, Jr. (1860–1953) was elected mayor of Chicago 4 years after his father's murder, and served 5 terms.
In 1855, Thomas Hughes (1789–1862), son of Cornelius Hughes, bought the farm from Carter Henry Harrison. He lived there with his wife Julia Ann Smith Hughes (1805–1846) and their four children, including daughter Kate Hughes McCreary (1844–1908), wife of Governor James B. McCreary (1838–1918) and son William Thomas Hughes (see next). Thomas and Julia Smith Hughes were buried on the Hughes farm, along with Thomas's brother, Michael Hughes, and his wife Mary Adams Hughes, and several children of one or the other couple. All of these family members were later re-interred in the Lexington Cemetery in a lot owned by Kate Hughes McCreary and Michael's son John T Hughes, noted Lexington horseman.
In 1862 William Thomas "WT" Hughes (1832–1874) inherited the farm from his father, Thomas Hughes, and lived there with his wife Sallie Kirkpatrick (Cooper) Hughes and their four children for over a decade. A large oil painting of their son Cooper Hughes (1862–1928) as a small boy, shows the original "Clifton" home in the background.
After the Civil War, Hughes began to buy more land, paying $100–$150 per acre at high interest rates, and not only breeding cattle but speculating in cattle in the New York market. WT borrowed heavily, and his loans were cosigned by his maternal uncle Granville Smith. In 1874, Hughes was forced to sell the farm to repay his creditors. In March 1874 Hughes sold of the Hughes farm to Milton H. Sanford.
In June 1874, WT Hughes and his wife were relocating to a smaller farm in a nearby county, riding alongside the Kentucky River in their buggy, with pack wagons full of chattel and children following behind, when William was shot and killed from the cliff top by his uncle Granville Smith. 
Later that day Smith (1807–1874) shot himself. Both men left widows and children. Smith was buried in the Lexington Cemetery, and Hughes was buried first in the Richmond Cemetery, and later reinterred in Lexington alongside his wife Sallie. In 1875 the Hughes heirs sold another to Richard Penniston.
In 1874, Milton H. Sanford purchased of the Hughes farm. Stanford had previously had a farm in New Jersey, named for the town of Preakness, New Jersey after which he also named his horse Preakness — the same horse for whom the Preakness Stakes is named. After moving to Kentucky, Sanford continued to use the same name. The stallion Virgil was based at Preakness Stud and sired three Kentucky Derby winners: Vagrant (1876), Hindoo (1881) and Ben Ali (1886).
In 1881, Sanford sold the land as well as his bloodstock (including Virgil and other leading sire Glenelg) to Daniel Swigert, who had been the manager of the Woodburn Stud as well as a "pinhooker", one who buys horses and quickly sells them. Swigert renamed the farm Elmendorf for his wife's grandmother, Blandina Elmendorf Brodhead. For years Swigert ran Elmendorf, breeding many exceptional horses. He also purchased and later sold the champion Spendthrift, which he had named after his wife's spending habits. A while later, his wife responded by naming Spendthrift's younger brother, Miser.
Before acquiring Elmendorf, Swigert had owned and then sold the 1870 Belmont Stakes winner Kingfisher, the 1873 Belmont Stakes winner Springbok and the 1877 Kentucky Derby winner Baden-Baden. He also bred the great Hindoo. While in charge of Elmendorf, Swigert bred Salvator, Firenze, and the Kentucky Derby winners Ben Ali and Apollo.
Swigert sold Elmendorf in October 1891 to Con J. Enright. Enright owned it for less than six years, but imported several good breeding mares from Europe. Enright most notably bred U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Hamburg. He sold the farm to James Ben Ali Haggin in 1897.
James Ben Ali Haggin, who already had had much success with Thoroughbreds in his Rancho Del Paso spread in California, expanded Elmendorf by buying quite a few of the surrounding farms. Under Haggin, the farm grew to over to over with 2,000 horses — his total investment was some $2 million. The expanded farm was centered along the Paris Pike, with over five miles of road frontage. In buying Elmendorf, Haggin bought Salvator, Miss Woodford, Firenze, Star Ruby, Water Boy, Hamburg Bell and quite a few other good horses. He stood the great Salvator here until the horse's death in 1909. It is possible that Salvator lies in an unmarked grave at Elmendorf.
Haggin also built a $300,000 mansion on a small hill overlooking Elk Horn which he called "Green Hills," a great Southern Mansion in style and feeling. He also built a model dairy farm and a greenhouse which he filled with exotic plants. The first record of Dexter cattle in the United States is when more than two hundred head were imported between 1905 and 1915, a large number of which were imported by Elmendorf Farm.
Haggin's extensive Kentucky interests, including Elmendorf Farm, were managed in his absence by Charles Henry Berryman of Lexington. The Berryman family lived on farm property in a house that is still called the Berryman House. After "Green Hills" was demolished by Joseph Widener, the Berryman Home was the only habitable mansion on the farm and as such was occupied by Widener's grandson, Peter A. B. Widener III (1925–1999) and his family during the 1950s.
When Haggin died in 1914, the estate was broken up.
In 1923, Joseph Widener (1871–1943) and his nephew, George, bought a part of Elmendorf. Joseph operated his portion as Elmendorf Form. George operated his portion as Old Kinney Farm. From then until the 1940s, the main part of Elmendorf was owned by Joseph Early Widener and then by his son Peter A. B. Widener II. In 1929, the elder Widener tore down Haggins' mansion "Green Hills" to void taxes on the unoccupied behemoth. He left the mansion's stately marble pillars which became a Central Kentucky landmark.
Widener bought the stallion Fair Play as well as the broodmare Mahubah at the dispersal sale of August Belmont. Fair Play and Mahubah, who were the sire and dam of Man o' War, are buried at what is now called Normandy Farm.
In 1950, Maxwell Henry Gluck (1896–1984) purchased the original section of Elmendorf Farm along with its name rights. Gluck, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Darlington Stores Corporation and later the United States Ambassador to Ceylon, had his first success in racing when he bought Prince John for $14,300 at the 1954 yearling sales. The pillars of Haggins' "Green Hills" remained on Gluck's farm, and in front of them are buried Gluck's juvenile champion Protagonist (by Prince John), Speak John (also by Prince John), and Verbatim. Gluck owned Elmendorf until his death in 1984 after which his widow sold it and about 350 horses to Jack Kent Cooke.
Cooke continued to use the property for his broodmare band until 1997, when he sold the remaining horses to Stonerside Stable. The property was sold to Dinwiddie Lampton, and is currently owned by the Lampton family's American Life and Accident Insurance Company. Most of the land is leased to Gaines-Gentry Thoroughbreds.
By 1951 Elmendorf had been reduced bit by bit as various parcels were sold off. The original section went to Max Gluck, along with its name - Elmendorf - and the remaining pillars of Green Hills. E. Barry Ryan bought the section with the original cemetery, calling it Normandy Farm whereon stood the statue of Fair Play erected by Widener. Buried in front of the statue are both Fair Play and Mahubah as well as many of their best sons and daughters bred by Widener, and quite a few other great runners. Other farms that were sliced from Elmendorf include Old Kinney Farm (owned by George D. Widener, Jr.) and Clovelly Farm (owned by Robin Scully).
Clovelly Farm still exists, as does the Normandy Farm. Green Gates Farm, once Spendthrift Farm and then the Old Kenney Farm, also still functions today.
Elmendorf was most recently acquired in 1997 for $5 million by Dinwiddie Lampton, Jr. (1914–2008), the president of American Life and Accident Co. Lampton and his wife were longtime coaching and pleasure driving enthusiasts with a collection of carriages and carriage horses. Lampton's wife, Elizabeth Whitcomb Lampton, died on March 22, 2008 at age 74, from a carriage accident on the property. Dinwiddie Lampton died six months later on September 25, 2008, at the farm.

Nielsen BookScan

Nielsen BookScan is a data provider for the book publishing industry, owned by the Nielsen Company. BookScan compiles point of sale data for book sales.
Following the success of Nielsen SoundScan which tracked point of sale figures for music, the Nielsen Company decided to launch a similar service for book sales. Nielsen BookScan was launched in January 2001. Previously, tracking of book sales, such as by the New York Times Best Seller list, was done without raw numbers. "The New York Times" would survey hundreds of outlets to estimate which books were selling the most copies, and would publish rankings but not figures. Only the publisher of a book tracked how many copies had been sold, but rarely shared this data.
Nielsen BookScan relies on point of sale data from a number of major book sellers. In 2009 Nielsen BookScan's US Consumer Market Panel covered 75% of retail sales.
BookScan was initially greeted with skepticism, but is now widely used by both the publishing industry and the media. Publishers use the numbers to track the success of their rivals. The media uses the figures as a reference to gauge a title's success. Daniel Gross of "Slate" has noted the increase of pundits using the figures to disparage each other.
BookScan also provided previously unavailable metrics on books published by multiple publishers, such as classic novels in the public domain which may be published by many different houses. Previously, no single entity had figures for the sales of these books; publishers and bookstores only knew their own sales. "Slate" noted that Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" was available from Amazon in 130 different editions; prior to BookScan there was no way to tabulate total sales. By summing BookScan data, however, "Pride and Prejudice" was reported to command sales of 110,000 a year, nearly 200 years after being published.
BookScan records cash register sales of books by tracking ISBNs when a clerk scans the barcode. However, BookScan only tracks print book sales, excluding ebook sale from online bookstore, such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Moreover, it cannot get all sale figures for printing book either, such as library sales , which plays a significant  role on book selling sometimes.

Marathon Enterprises, Inc.

Marathon Enterprises, Inc. is a major regional supplier of meats and gourmet delicatessen products to the food service industry in the New York City metropolitan area. Headquartered in Englewood, New Jersey, it is a private corporation, and sells its products under the "Sabrett" brand name.
Gregory Papalexis, of Greek descent, was the owner and president of the company. After he graduated from New York University in 1948, Papalexis and a partner established a new provisions company. When it was discovered the name "Sabre Meat Company" had already been taken in New York City, the pair agreed on "Sabre-ette", which was later shortened to Sabrett. Though Papalexis initially started to sell hot dog buns, he eventually decided to produce the hot dogs and sell them from "House O' Weenies" stainless steel push carts with the now familiar blue and yellow umbrellas.
The company's flagship product is the Sabrett brand frankfurter. They and other meats such as pastrami and salami are processed at the Marathon factory in the Bronx, New York. The frankfurters are sold through Sabrett branded carts on the streets of New York City and elsewhere in the metropolitan area, local supermarkets, and club locations such as BJ's, Costco, and Jetro.
Other products sold under the Sabrett brand name include condiments popular on hot dogs such as sauerkraut, sweet relish, spicy brown mustard, and a red onion sauce known as "Sabrett's Prepared Onions."

Third World Media

Third World Media is an adult entertainment production studio founded in 1999 by Steve Scott and director Ed Hunter. It was one of the first producers of entertainment featuring ethnic performers exclusively from outside the United States.
The company, initially named Asian Eyes Pictures, placed an emphasis on Japanese hardcore content in its early years. As the company grew, it expanded its production to Southeast Asia and South America. In late 2006, Third World Media added Katana, a high-end Japanese lineup featuring popular Japanese AV stars and scripted, subtitled story lines.
Scott, a fluent Japanese speaker, credits the growth of his company to his extensive travels in Asia. When Third World Media entered the adult market, the Japanese product entering the US market was produced for the Japanese domestic market, where penetration is blurred, or "mosaiced" to conform with their laws. Third World Media produces movies for distribution outside Japan, and its hardcore products are shot without mosaics.
Like the company's Asian titles, its Latin titles, which include transsexual titles, are also produced to be sold primarily in the American market. Third World Media's veteran in-house director Ed Hunter makes frequent travels to South America to find performers who've never been seen by American audiences. The company also added John Florian as its sales manager in January 2008.
The company is also the exclusive distributor of transsexual performer Gia Darling's production company, Gia Darling Entertainment. Other adult film stars featured in Third World Media movies include: Mai Haruna, Monica Mattos, Chocoball Mukai, Ed Powers, Allanah Starr, Gia Darling, among others. Japanese AV idols Junko, featured in "The Kimono Kronicles",and Mirai Haneda, star of Hello "Titty 3", signed at Third World Media's 2008 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo booth.
The company was named the "Best Asian Release Company" in 2007 and 2008 by consumer adult video review magazine Adam Film World. At the 2009 AVN Awards the company won 'Best Ethnic-Themed Series – Asian' for "Naughty Little Asians" In January 2013 the company received XBIZ Awards for Transsexual Studio of the Year and Asian-Themed Series of the Year for "Hello Titty".

Zambon

Zambon is an Italian company that has been operating in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry since 1906.
Headquartered in Bresso, in the Province of Milan, the company has business operations in three continents: Europe, South America and Asia. The company employs approximately 2,600 people in 15 countries and its integrated organisation consists of Zambon Company SpA, the industrial holding company for the group which comprises Zach System (fine chemicals), Zambon SpA (pharmaceuticals) and Z-Cube (Research Venture).
Gaetano Zambon, founder of the group, was born in Malo in the Province of Vicenza on 31 December 1878. His father Giovanni owned a corn business.
Gaetano Zambon studied pharmacy at the University of Padua and graduated in 1902. Seeing the potential and growth of the pharmaceutical sector, he decided to sell products directly to pharmacies. Partnering with Silvio Farina, the two bought out the Rossi medical products warehouse on Corso Fogazzaro in Vicenza in August 1906 and officially founded the Magazzino Medicinali Zambon (Zambon Medical Products Warehouse) on 11 November 1906.
The Warehouse distributed basic pharmaceutical products such as bismuth, iodine and bicarbonate, and also other commodities such as liquorice, spices and talcum powder. In 1908, the two partners established Gaetano Zambon & Co whose shares were divided equally between Gaetano, Silvio Farina and Teodorico Viero. In 1911, the business expanded over the entire region, forcing them to move to new offices.
The outbreak of the First World War slowed business but did not halt it altogether. Gaetano Zambon provided services for the Military Medical Corps and during this period, partners Teodorico Viero, Silvio Farina and Arrigo Giacomelli expanded the company to include Giovanni Ferrari who also had a background in pharmaceuticals and sales.
G. Zambon & Co. had a small plant that produced products for chemists such as Elixir di China (Elixir of Quinine), Ferrochina (iron and quinine citrate bitters), Rheum (rhubarb) and an insecticide called ITE. In 1920, Gaetano Zambon and his partners established their product lines, founding the first laboratory for speciality products and galenic formulations, under the brand name ZeF (Zambon and Farina), for distribution to pharmacies and hospitals. In 1930, they bought an old fertiliser plant which was to become the company’s new pharmaceutical production facility. The first Synthetic Product Department was established in 1933, completing the pharmaceutical production process from raw material to finished product.
In 1937, Gaetano Zambon and Silvio Farina were appointed Knights of the Order of the Crown of Italy and in 1938, after the departure of Teodorico from the company, they formed Zambon & C. Società Anonima per Azioni (Zambon & Co. Join Stock Company), and increasing the number of employees from 100 to 300 within a decade. During the Second World War, the factory suffered heavy bombing on 14 May 1944 and much of it was destroyed. The new Zambon plant was opened in September 1946, with the Minister of Foreign Trade, Pietro Campilli in attendance. Pharmaceuticals produced by Zambon were also sold abroad.
After the Second World War, the first generation of Zambon partners decided to hand over the reins to the younger generation. After parting ways with the Farina branch in 1951 and the Ferraris in 1957, Alberto Zambon took over the management of the company. Gaetano Zambon died in 1959 at the age of 81 years, and the company changed its name once more to Zambon SpA.
Alberto Zambon established good relationships in the United States and with a few large multinationals existing at that time, especially in the field of research, so that the company could develop its own pharmaceuticals rather than licensing them.
The company expanded abroad, setting up both production facilities and commercial operations. They opened the first production plant in Brazil in 1956 under the name Zambon Laboratorios Farmaceuticos SA, which was changed to Ltda in 1993.
Zambon SA was established in Barcelona, Spain, in 1960 to serve the Iberian Peninsula (an independent Portuguese headquarters was opened in Lisbon, in 1992).
In 1961, Alberto Zambon moved the main headquarters and research laboratories to Bresso, Milan, while the production facility remained in Vicenza.
In 1963, Inpharzam was founded in Lamone, Switzerland, which served as a holding group for all the international businesses. This branch later moved to Cadempino, where a specialist pharmaceutical production plant was established. Davizam SA, Siphar and the Inpharzam Trading Company SA were also established in Lugano. 
Founded in the same year, Zambon France focused on sales and exports to Africa and Australia. 
Fluimicil went on the market in 1965. During this period, the company started to build relationships in Japan through a collaboration with EISAI, which produced injectable Chloramphenicol in Japan. 
A new chemical ingredients plant was built in Almisano di Lonigo in 1970.
In 1975, Zambon Colombia SA was established with headquarters in Bogota. 
In 1980, Inpharzam International established relationships with various companies, including Carlo Erba.
In 1983, Zambon bought out Emilio Ghirardi’s company Simes and production was moved to a new plant in Vicenza in 1984. That same year, Zambon B.V. was founded with headquarters in Amsterdam and Zambon Nederland BV was established. 
A year later, Alberto Zambon was appointed a Knight of the Order of Merit for Labour, exactly 50 years after his father’s nomination.
1989 saw the founding of both Zambon UK and Zambon Corporation for the American market.
In 1996, the Shantou Shanning Zambon Chemicals Ltd (Equity Joint Venture) was founded and its plant was opened a year later. 
In Europe, Inpharzam SA was established in Belgium in 1995.
In 2000, a second Chinese plant was opened in Hainan, dividing chemical and pharmaceutical production between Shantou and Hainan. In 2002 Zambon India was established and Zambon Indonesia two years later.
The group invested in the respiratory field, especially in the treatment of severe diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rare illnesses, and in June 2013, Zambon acquired Profile Pharma[1] in the United Kingdom, which specialised in cystic fibrosis. At the same time, Zambon entered the central nervous system therapy area with the molecule safinamide

Hy-Line Cruises

Hy-Line Cruises (colloquially referred to as Hy-Line, and legally Hyannis Harbor Tours Inc.) is a family owned and operated Massachusetts ferry and cruise company. The company currently operates the second largest passenger ferry service between mainland Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket (after the Steamship Authority). The company also operates sightseeing cruises and fishing charters. The company's main office is located at 22 Channel Point Road in Hyannis.
Hy-Line Cruises began operations in 1962 as Hyannis Harbor Tours run by Richard Scudder and his brother Robert. Originally, the company focused on sightseeing harbor tours, which it still does today. The company adding deep sea fishing charters in 1966, and started running seasonal passenger ferry services in 1970, first to Martha's Vineyard, and then to Nantucket in 1972 when Hyannis Harbor Tours bought out The Nantucket Boat Company which at that time was doing business as Hi-line. Hyannis Harbor Tours took this trade name and changed it to Hy-Line.
In 1995, Hy-Line Cruises started the first high-speed catamaran service to Nantucket; its original vessel was shortly replaced by a larger one in 1997, which in turn was replaced in 2003 by the "Grey Lady". Hy-Line introduced high-speed service to Martha's Vineyard in 2005, using its 1997-built ferry "Lady Martha". Another high-speed catamaran, "Grey Lady IV", was delivered in 2016 to replace Hy-Line's monohull vessel on the Nantucket route.
Hy-Line Cruises operates high-speed catamaran ferry service between Hyannis and Nantucket (year-round) and Hyannis and Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard (seasonally). The journey time is approximately one hour. The company also operates inter-island trips between Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
All of Hy-Line Cruises' ferry services are passenger only (although bicycles are carried) due to the legal monopoly held on vehicle ferry service that is held by the Steamship Authority.
Hy-Line Cruises also operates seasonal sightseeing cruises in and around Hyannis Harbor, and the Cape Cod Canal, (the latter sailing from the Wareham village of Onset).
Out of Hyannis, Hy-Line operates seasonal half-day deep sea fishing trips in Nantucket Sound.

Lone Star Music

Lone Star Music, also called LSM, is a San Marcos, Texas-based music company which operates a website drawing half a million visitors a month, as well as a retail outlet in San Marcos, Texas and a glossy bi-monthly magazine focusing on Texas and Americana music.
Lone Star Music was founded in 1999 by Chad Raney while living in New Braunfels, Texas, as an internet site dedicated to selling Texas music. Raney had had successful previous experiences as an entrepreneur. Most of the initial 1,300 artists were on independent labels. In December 2002 Raney found himself in the hospital, leaving Christmas orders un-shipped. Michael and Clair Devers, friends of Raney's, took over the operation while he was recovering. By mid-2003 Raney had made them both partners(49% of the company between them), allowing them to run daily operations while he stayed in Texarkana. In March 2004 a Lone Star Music retail store was opened in the historic Gruene district, which is located within New Braunfels city limits. A second retail store was opened in Kerrville, Texas in September 2007, but was closed the following year.
In 2009, Raney and the Devers sold the company to another Texas entrepreneur, Zach Jennings, who immediately began expanding both the online and physical store's inventory to include more Americana roots and rock music by artists from beyond the Texas and Oklahoma regions. In 2012, Jennings moved the physical store from Gruene to San Marcos, TX, re-opening as "Superfly's Lone Star Music Emporium" in September, 2012. Although the online LoneStarMusic retail site continues to specialize in Texas and Americana music, Superfly's store in San Marcos carries all genres, with a large selection of new and used vinyl.
On May 20, 2006, the 8-foot statue of Texas musician Bob Wills was discovered to have been pulled over during the night. The statue's arm was broken off, lying on the ground next to it. Spurred by the upcoming Bob Wills Day, the vandalism made headlines on hundreds of news organizations around the world. The story was covered on CNN, Yahoo, and CBS.com.
In 2006, Lone Star Music acquired Mavrik Magazine, a glossy, full-color bi-monthly magazine dedicated to covering Texas and Red Dirt Music. In September 2007 the name of the magazine was changed to LoneStarMusic Magazine. It is distributed free at venues, bars, restaurants and other locations throughout Texas and Oklahoma (along with a few other states). Since Zach Jennings purchased the company in 2009, the magazine — just like the online retail store — has expanded its coverage to feature articles not just on Texas songwriters and musicians, but artists from across the Americana and roots rock/folk spectrum.

Recyclebank

Recyclebank is a company based in New York City that aims to encourage recycling and environmentally-friendly habits. It brings together people, businesses, and communities to achieve real world impact by participating in household recycling and teaching how to live more sustainable lifestyles. Over 4 million people have signed up through Recyclebank's rewards program, which offers magazine subscriptions and discounts among other goods. Recyclebank’s online shop, OneTwine.com, combines the company’s sustainability expertise and rewards program to help people make more green choices when purchasing products. A Certified B Corporation, Recyclebank is headquartered in New York City.
In 2001, New York City was considering cancelling its recycling program. Then Fordham Law student Patrick FitzGerald realized that there was no true economic incentive to encourage people to recycle. He drafted a business model wherein people would be financially incentivized to recycle, businesses would be able to promote sustainability and cities and municipalities could see the results of dramatically increased recycling rates. In 2003, he contacted an old high school friend of his, Ron Gonen, who was then pursuing his MBA at Columbia. Together, the two of them set out to build Recyclebank and a year later, they completed the company’s founding business plan. By 2004, they rolled out a pilot recycling rewards program in Philadelphia. Today, Recyclebank partners with communities all over the country and offers new ways for one to learn, earn points, and shop online.
Further, since 2009, Recyclebank has been a certified B Corporation, meeting rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability.
Recyclebank also partners with NativeEnergy, a company that helps businesses reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, in order to offset its own carbon footprint. Between 2011 and 2012, Recyclebank reduced its carbon footprint by nearly 30% by making smarter travel decisions and being more conscious of its waste and recycling habits.
Recyclebank uses the idea of "gaming for good," which combines game mechanics with environmental good, as they believe it can have a measurable impact on consumer behavior and the environment.
Gamification is used by brands to motivate employees, create healthy competition among teams, generate buzz or social proof, and encourage customer loyalty, among other benefits.
When Recyclebank was founded in 2004, gamification was not a well-known term, however elements of gamification, such as points and rewards,
have been embedded in Recyclebank from the start. These gaming elements make recycling easy for people to relate to, it provides motivation and it helps put behavior in context of the larger community. Though Recyclebank started by focusing on curbside recycling, there are now many more ways to earn points. Members can earn by pledging to do various things: unplugging appliances, choosing greener products, taking shorter showers, and making green travel decisions (like carpooling and taking public transportation), or by taking quizzes to learn more about how to recycle certain things, or even by simply reading a slideshow for tips or more information about new advances in sustainability.
Each year, the Recyclebank Green Schools Program awards grants for unique environmental projects that positively affect students, schools and communities. Through the Green Schools Program, Recyclebank teaches children how to turn sustainable ideas into action and inspire them to make a real impact in their classrooms and communities. Recyclebank's partner Domtar Corporation, the sustainable paper company, helped make more green projects a reality by contributing additional donation dollars to participating schools. As part of its support for the Green Schools Program, in 2014 Domtar also planned to award a year's supply of Domtar EarthChoice® Office Paper to the school with the most innovative project.
Since 2007, the Recyclebank Green Schools Program has awarded close to $500,000 to more than 150 schools for projects designed to creatively improve their schools. Each year participating schools, their students and their communities work to encourage residents to donate Recyclebank points that the company then transfers into real dollars for schools—turning a community's green actions into funds for a local school. Because of this year's impressive submissions, Recyclebank is also funding up to 50 percent of each proposal that did not meet its goal.
In addition to providing a year's supply of paper to the C.W. Henry School, Domtar awarded $500 to each school that was able to reach 50 percent of its donation goal. More than half of the 29 participating schools reached 50 percent of their fundraising goals and will receive funds from Domtar.
With the launch of the new online shop, One Twine, Recyclebank also announced that it will donate 5% of profits to the Green Schools Program.
On Earth Day 2014 (April 22), Recyclebank launched One Twine, a new online shop to discover carefully vetted products that are better for your home, your wallet and the planet. In addition to discovering socially and environmentally conscious goods, customers will also find great deals on the products they love on OneTwine.com. To get even more value, Recyclebank members can apply the points they've earned for learning how to live more sustainably and taking actions toward purchases on One Twine.
Building on Recyclebank's expertise in sustainability, every item on One Twine has been evaluated through their Impact Lens, a list of nine criteria that consider the product's total environmental impact. To help people make more informed choices, One Twine clearly displays icons next to each product that highlight which criteria it meets, and includes insightful content related to those principles.
One Twine's Impact Lens considers the following criteria for each product:
The name One Twine is a nod to the traditional corner store, the community hub where shopkeepers connected individuals with high-quality, all-natural goods. Purchases at this store were often bound by brown paper and twine—a single thread woven from many fibers. Recyclebank feels this image ties into the online shop’s theme because just like those durable, interwoven threads of twine, they believe that through making small actions and buying great products, people and the brand can be collectively bound for a better future.
At launch, One Twine featured more than 400 products from nearly 30 brands across household, health and beauty, children, pets, and gear and gadgets categories. Shoppers can find a mix of established brands as well as up-and-coming companies.
One Twine now has 1,000 products on the site.

Burl's Aircraft

Burl's Aircraft LLC is an American aircraft parts manufacturer located in Chugiak, Alaska. The company was founded in 1982 by Burl A Rogers, to design, engineer and manufacture Federal Aviation Administration approved parts for light aircraft.
The company was established in February 1982 as "Burl’s Aircraft Rebuild" and was granted FAA inspection authorization in 1985.
The company's first product was the FAA approved Magnum I tailwheel penetration ski, made available in 1982. The eight different models of this product have sold 425 units in the past 25 years.
The Alpha Omega Suspension System was developed to a customer specification as a replacement for existing bungee landing gear shocks used on aircraft. The customer noted that the traditional shocks leak and wear out as well as provide too much bounce upon landing. Roger's design employs solid polymer as the shock-absorber, housed in a steel-plated cylinder that is sealed with epoxy and mounted with titanium tubes.
Burl A Rogers purchased the Aircraft Type Certificate for the Aeronca Sedan in July 2000 from William Brad Mitchell and has since then manufactured parts for the design and issued Service Bulletins. The Sedan is known to the FAA as the "Burl A. Rogers 15AC Sedan" since the purchase of the type certificate, although no complete aircraft have yet been produced by the company.

Royal District Nursing Service (Victoria)

RDNS (Royal District Nursing Service) was founded in 1885. 
RDNS is a not-for-profit charity in Australia which provides home nursing and healthcare to people throughout metro Melbourne, parts of regional Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia, the North Island of New Zealand and the provinces of Otago and Southland in the South Island of New Zealand.
RDNS provides a range of healthcare services including:
The Melbourne District Nursing Society began in 1885 with a single nurse visiting the homes of the sick and poor to provide compassionate nursing care. With no other nursing service of its kind, support for the newfound form of healthcare grew. As a result, by 1892, more staff were employed to cope with demands and the organisation implemented its own midwifery service. In 1898, a meeting was held in the local town hall and it was decided to start a Collingwood branch of the Melbourne District Nursing Society.
By 1906, the organisation had extended its healthcare service to the outer suburbs of Melbourne and employed the use of bicycles to efficiently travel around the city. This form of transportation enabled district nurses to reach more clients, more quickly over a wider geographical area.
The Great War saw the onset of 1919 influenza epidemic and placed increasing pressure on the organisation to service more and more clientele. To expedite the amount of clients treated, the organisation invested in its first motor car, which would later become an integral identifier of the modern-day RDNS brand.
Following the opening of an aftercare hospital in 1926, the organisation extended its care to mothers and infants by opening Melbourne's first "Well baby clinic", which later became a motivating factor in the development of Victoria's first family planning clinic.
Like the Great War, World War II increased the demand for services and the organisation's type of clientele soon became anyone who had a genuine nursing need regardless of age, condition or circumstance. With the expanded need for services, the organisation decentralised its business by opening its first suburban centre in Camberwell.
In the 1980s, RDNS began to provide post-acute care treatments for HIV/AIDS, cystic fibrosis and other chronic treatments, care which had previously been confined to hospitals but could now be administered in the home. The HIV Program became integrated with the Victorian AIDS Council's (VAC) HIV Services in the early 1990s, and this relationship has endured for 25 years. Volunteers and paid workers through VAC provide practical assistance and social support and the RDNS nurses provide care coordination and professional nursing care for people living with HIV in the community. The RDNS HIV Program joined with the RDNS Homeless Person's Program in 2015.
Demand for RDNS’ services has continued to grow strongly year on year, with 2012 seeing the most number of visits ever provided - 1,962,179.
RDNS provides a 24-hour home nursing and homecare service to the people throughout Australia.
Rally HomeCare provides community nursing and home care to older Australians, war veterans and widows, people with disabilities and others in the privacy of people’s own home.
RDNS NZ is a not-for-profit organisation which provides health and homecare across New Zealand.
The RDNS Institute works to promote excellence in community health through education, research and clinical practice.

Azure Dynamics

Azure Dynamics Corporation is incorporated under the laws of Alberta, Canada having been spun out of BC Research Inc. Azure now is headquartered in Oak Park, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The company's principal business is in the development and integration of its proprietary electric and hybrid electric drive technology, primarily for the light and heavy duty commercial vehicle categories.
Due to financial difficulties, Azure filed for bankruptcy protection in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in March 2012, and production of the Transit Connect Electric van and Balance hybrid was stopped.
The Transit Connect Electric is an all-electric van developed as a collaboration between Azure Dynamics and Ford Motor Company, but Azure is the official manufacturer of record. Production began in December 2010, and will reach full capacity in April 2011 to produce between 600 and 700 units a year. 
The Transit Connect Electric is produced using a vehicle glider at a Ford Motor Company facility in Kocaeli, Turkey and then shipped to Azure Dynamics U.S. upfitter, AM General in Livonia, Michigan, where the Force Drive electric drive train and other components are added to the vehicle. Azure Dynamics has partnered with Johnson Controls-Saft to produce the lithium-ion battery pack used in the Transit Connect Electric. The vehicle is badged with both the Ford Blue Oval and Azure's Force Drive logos, with Azure Dynamics being the manufacturer of record.
According to Ford and Azure, the Transit Connect Electric has an all-electric range of up to , but the official US Environmental Protection Agency range is . The electric van has a speed up to .
The rated the combined city/highway fuel economy at 62 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent () based on the five-cycle tests using varying driving conditions and climate controls, with the same 62 mpg-e rating for both city and highway. The energy consumption for combined city/highway was rated at 54 kW·h/100 mi.
The Azure Dynamics Balance Hybrid Electric vehicle is built on the Ford E-450 commercial stripped or cutaway chassis. The vehicle is modified with the Azure Force Drive Electric drivetrain technology, along with the Johnson Controls-Saft Lithium-Ion battery, by Utilimaster and then sent to one of Azure's bus body manufactures such as Collins Bus, Champion Bus, ElDorado National, Goshen Coach, StarTrans and TurtleTop where it is built as a shuttle bus, Class A school bus, delivery truck, etc. Azure Dynamics owns approximately 60% market share of the medium duty commercial hybrid truck market
The Force Drive Electric is a proprietary electric drive train component developed by Azure Dynamics. This drive system is based upon the product originally developed by Solectria Corporation, which was acquired by Azure Dynamics in 2005. The Force Drive drive train is integrated into the Ford Transit Connect Electric, Ford E-Series Balance Hybrid, as well has a number of other passenger and medium and heavy duty trucks. The Force Drive was used in the Wave II electric vehicle developed by Li-Ion Motors, the $2.5 million prize winner in the "Alternative Side by Side Class" category of the 2010 Progressive X-Prize competition.
Solectria Corporation was an American corporation based in Woburn, Massachusetts. Azure Dynamics Corporation acquired all assets of Solectria Corporation in 2005. Solectria is credited for the original development of the ForceDrive Electric drive train, which was known at the time as the Solectria Force. The Solectria Sunrise set an all-electric vehicle record by traveling 375 miles on a single charge during the 1996 NESEA American Tour de Sol.

Smith Electric Vehicles

Smith Electric Vehicles (also known as Smith's) is a manufacturer of zero emission commercial electric vehicles. The company was founded in 1920 in the North of England but in 2011 moved its headquarters to Kansas City, Missouri.
Smith manufactures the largest range of zero-emission commercial electric vehicles in the world, with Gross Vehicle Weights (GVWs) from 3,500 kg – 12,000 kg.
It was formerly based in Washington, Tyne and Wear, Smith produces vehicles for the US, Canadian, European and South-East Asia markets. It was formerly part of The Tanfield Group Plc, which trades on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.
Tanfield established a separate company, Smith Electric Vehicles US Corp (SEV US Corp) in 2009 to penetrate the North American market. A Delaware corporation. Its headquarters is in Kansas City, Missouri. The United States company in March 2010 indicated it wanted to buy out the UK company.
After many years of poor trading history the UK arms of Smith were shut down. This included Smith Electric Vehicles (Europe) Ltd which was put into Administration and Smith Technologies Ltd which was put into Liquidation.
The company was founded in 1920 as Northern Coachbuilders in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. After making a name as a producer of electric trams and trolley buses, it moved into road-going electric delivery vehicles. Smith Electric Vehicles was born.
The name comes from the Smith family that founded the business and ran it until 2004. The family remains in North East England and it still owns Ringtons Tea, engaged in the importation, blending and distribution of tea.
The Smith Electric Vehicles business in the 1950s and 60s focussed on the milk float, a vehicle solely engaged in the doorstep delivery of milk and other dairy products. As the dairies phased out delivery by horse and cart, they opted for near-silent electric vehicles for their early morning deliveries, instead of the noisier ICE-powered vans and trucks.
In the mid-1960s, Smith launched the Smith Cabac, the first float to have a rear entry cab so the milkman could exit the vehicle on either side. Smith produced four series of the Cabac; the 65, 75, Jubilee 77 and 85.
In 1989 the company acquired Wales & Edwards.
The company took its first steps into North America in 1962. Smith Delivery Vehicles Ltd, by then based in Gateshead, signed a partnership with coachbuilder Boyertown and the Exide Division of the Electric Storage Battery of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to produce an electric-powered route delivery truck.
The Boyertown-Smith connection had been made in the late 1950s, when the British firm’s managing director was in the United States exploring a partnership with William and James Conway, the owners of Mister Softee, whose mobile ice-cream trucks were built by Boyertown.
Smith eventually secured the United Kingdom rights to the Mister Softee brand from the Conways and started producing Mister Softee electric ice cream floats in 1959, in partnership with a J. Lyons & Co. subsidiary named Glacier Foods Ltd.
The Smith family approached the firm with the Battronic proposal in 1962. At that time there were more than 14,000 Smith Electrics in service across the United Kingdom and Western Europe.
The new company was organized as the Battronic Truck Corporation. Exide’s parent company was a producer of motor vehicle traction batteries and Smith was a producer of electric delivery vehicles. Boyertown’s contribution was its high-strength, lightweight Multalloy body.
Early Battronics had a top speed of and could carry a payload up to on a single charge. The Potomac Edison Company of Hagerstown, Maryland, took delivery of the first production Battronic in March 1964.
Smith withdrew from the partnership in 1966, and Battronic ultimately produced and sold fewer than 200 vehicles in its entire 20 year life (1963–1983).
Back in the UK, the rise of the supermarket coincided with the end of around half of all milk rounds during the 1990s. Faced with a downturn in orders for its Cabac, Smith diversified into niche vehicles. The Smith ST range of 7.5t low-speed electric trucks were marketed at low-speed municipal operations and interior applications that mandated heavy duty vehicles with zero exhaust emissions. Smith ST vehicles are used in nuclear power stations, large factories and former salt mines converted into records storage facilities.
The company rebranded itself as SEV Group Ltd and diversified into fleet management, mobile vehicle repair and the sale, hire and maintenance of fork lift trucks and materials handling equipment.
The Tanfield Group Plc, an engineering company also based in North East England, acquired SEV Group Ltd in October 2004, for £2.2m and 1 million new ordinary shares. Tanfield immediately restored the historic Smith Electric Vehicles brand name and initiated R&D work to develop new electric delivery vehicles.
A proof of concept vehicle called the Faraday was launched in October 2005, with a top speed of , a range of up to in urban operations and payload capabilities of up to 2,000 kg. Built on Smith’s own all-steel chassis, the Faraday had a Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) in excess of 5,000 kg. Early adopters such as TNT N.V. and Sainsbury’s wanted an electric vehicle that better matched UK driving licence restrictions. In the UK, anyone with a valid licence can drive a light commercial vehicle up to 3,500 kg GVW. For vehicles between 3,500 kg and 12,000 kg, the driver requires a C1 commercial vehicle licence.
Based on this feedback, Smith launched the Newton 7.5t truck in 2006, which housed the electric drive line technology in an established truck chassis from Avia in the Czech Republic. Leading express and mail operator TNT N.V. took the first Newton for assessment in its London fleet. A new production facility for Smith Electric Vehicles was built in Washington, Tyne & Wear, and was officially opened by Prime Minister Tony Blair in February 2007. He said: "This will be a company that will really make its presence felt not just in the North East, but actually throughout the world."
In April the same year Smith Electric Vehicles unveiled the Smith Edison. Based on the Ford Transit, this was the first electric light commercial vehicle to have a GVW of less than 3,500 kg – meeting the "everyman" driving licence requirement of UK fleet operators. First movers to deploy the Edison included the retailer Sainsbury’s and utility company Scottish & Southern Energy. Also in April, TNT N.V. ordered a fleet of 50 Smith Newton trucks, following its successful trial of the first vehicle in 2006.
Smith was one of several electric commercial vehicle companies invited to the Department for Transport (DfT) in London, for discussions on how the UK Government might help stimulate the market for commercial electric vehicles. This led to the announcement of the Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme, in the Government’s Energy White Paper of May 2007.
During the summer of 2007, Smith produced its first vehicles for export, which were delivered to TNT NV in the Netherlands. In December it also showed its Newton truck in North America and announced plans to establish a US production facility.
In 2008 Smith appointed its first full-service distributor, Electric Vehicles Ireland. And in April, Smith and Ford of Europe announced an "official collaboration" on the future development of commercial electric vehicles, starting with the Smith Ampere, a pure electric version of the Ford Transit Connect.
However, by the end of June 2008 Smith’s parent company, Tanfield, reported the cancellation and postponement of customer orders.
In November, Smith Electric was shortlisted for the Department for Transport's Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme, a subsidy scheme that allowed public sector bodies to buy electric and low carbon vans for the same price as the equivalent diesel vehicle.
Electric vehicle sales for 2008 were £25.1m (2007: £26.1m). Smith’s parent company, Tanfield, cited a combination of supply chain constraints and fleet operators reducing spend in line with their own decline in sales, plus the lack of available credit facilities for those who did want to purchase. Furthermore, the recession also impacted on the company’s plans to open a production facility in the USA.
After restructuring its operations in line with the downturn in demand, in February 2009, Tanfield announced the formation of Smith Electric Vehicles US Corp (Smith US), a joint venture that is 49% owned by Tanfield, with the 51% majority share owned by private investors and Smith US management.
Along with establishing an associate company in the USA, Smith adopted a policy of appointing full-service distributors in all foreign markets that were offering incentives for EVs. The company defines a "full-service distributor" as one who can sell products and also has the technical expertise to provide after-sales service and spare parts.
In March 2009, Smith delivered its first Newton electric truck to Electric Vehicles Ireland, its official distributor for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The 10,000 kg vehicle was purchased by building materials retailer Grange Builders Providers, of Dublin.
This was followed by the appointment of AllGreenVehicles in The Netherlands as the full-service distributor for the Benelux region.
At the Geneva Motor Show, Ford displayed a concept pure electric people-carrier called Ford_Tourneo_Connect#Electric, a version of the Ford Transit Connect. This prototype was produced by Smith Electric Vehicles.
2009 was also the year that the UK Government began funding electric vehicles. In June, Smith announced that it was one of the successful bidders into the Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator Programme (ULCVDP), administered by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB). This programme provided match funding for the development of demonstrator electric passenger vehicles. Smith announced it would produce a seven-seat, executive minibus; 10 London taxis based on LTI’s TX4 chassis; and five people carriers, similar to the concept Ford_Tourneo_Connect#Electric that Ford exhibited in Geneva.
The same month, the UK Government confirmed that Smith was one of three electric van manufacturers in the final shortlist of suppliers into the Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme.
In November, Tanfield announced it was terminating its involvement in the electric Ford Transit Connect project in both North America and Europe, by mutual consent with Ford. Smith cited the unexpected early success of its Newton all-electric truck in the US market; Smith US already had an order book for 255 units and therefore decided to focus its resources on the Newton product. In Europe, Tanfield felt the market for smaller vans was becoming too competitive.
Meanwhile, Smith UK appointed Sime Darby Motors as its distributor for Hong Kong and Macau.
Smith UK secured repeat business from Sainsbury’s, which ordered an additional 50 Smith Edison electric vans. Combined with Sainsbury’s existing 20 electric vans, this created the largest fleet of new technology electric commercial vehicles in the world.
Both the Smith Edison and Smith Newton vehicles took part in a parade of low carbon vehicles as part of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.
Sales of electric vehicles declined in 2009 to £15.1m (2008: £25.1m). However, Smith Electric Vehicles grew its customer base over the year and increased export sales, from less than 1% of sales in 2008 to more than 15% of sales in 2009.
In 2010 the company supplied 10 Smith Edison vans to Ford of Europe for the colognE-mobil project in Cologne, Germany. The first phase of the project was to examine the potential benefits of electric commercial vehicles in Cologne, then forecast how they might affect Germany's plans to deploy 1 million zero emission vehicles by 2020.
In March ElecTruckCity was appointed as its distributor in France.
In April Phase One was initiated of the UK's Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme. Smith received 67% of the orders for electric vans; more than double the combined number of orders won by the other two electric van suppliers in the programme, (Modec and Allied Electric).
At the Commercial Vehicle Operator Show in the UK, Smith celebrated its 90th anniversary. The company also announced SmithLink, the first telematics system for electric commercial vehicles. This provided real-time data on battery state-of-charge and vehicle location, along with the data-monitoring required for government-funded projects such as the DOE programme in the USA and the Department for Transport programme in the UK.
The company also launched of the UK’s first all-electric, 17-seat minibus at the CV Operator Show, held in Birmingham NEC. The Smith Edison minibus is based on the Ford Transit minibus chassis.
In 2011, its subsidiary in Kansas City, Missouri, acquired its parent for $15 million and moved its headquarters to Kansas City International Airport. The new company announced that it was exploring the potential for an initial public offering (IPO). Tanfield maintains 49% ownership in the new company. Bryan Hansel is the CEO. Ultimately this initial stock offering failed to complete.
In June Smith announced that it had passed 700 deployed vehicles and over 5 million miles of operation.
In August Smith signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Taikang Technology Corp. in Taiwan. The agreement covers assembly and distribution of all-electric vehicles in Taiwan with the Smith brand.
In September Smith deployed its first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) vehicles at Fort Carson, Colorado. The deployment is part of the Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security (SPIDERS) project.
In October Smith entered into a Letter of Intent with Sinopoly, an internationally renowned battery supplier with a strategic goal to develop markets in Mainland China and Taiwan.
In May Smith reached an agreement with Sinopoly Battery Limited, a Hong Kong-based battery manufacturer which aims to raise $40 million for the firm.
On 9 June, Smith launched the first all electric commercial truck in Italy. This Italian version of the Newton was delivered to Niinivirta Transport S.p.A. at a ceremony in Milan.
In August 2014 Smith Electric Vehicles purchased a small, but OTCBB traded, Colorado company for $340,000 as part of a strategy to become a publicly traded company.
Also in August 2014 a UK part of the company separated as SEV, through a management buy out, to focus on the European maintenance and services sector.
After many years of poor trading history the UK arms of Smith were shut down. This included Smith Electric Vehicles (Europe) Ltd which was put into Administration and Smith Technologies Ltd which was put into Liquidation.
Launched in 2006, the Newton electric truck was the first fully productionised, new technology, electric commercial vehicle from Smith. Smith offers Newton in three GVW configurations: 7,500 kg, 10,000 kg and 12,000 kg. Each is available in short, medium or long wheelbase. 
The truck is currently powered by a 120 kilowatt electric permanent-magnet motor and driven by Lithium-Ion Iron Phosphate batteries with A123 Systems modules . Smith offers the battery pack in either 80kWh or 120kWh configurations.
Customers in Europe include TNT Express, TK Maxx, DHL, Balfour Beatty, Bunzl, AG Barr, the Office of Public Works in Ireland and Celtic Linen in Dublin.
In the United States, Frito-Lay is one of the main customers, with 176 Newton delivery trucks in operation by January 2011, representing about 1 percent of Frito-Lay's total fleet. Other American customers include The Coca-Cola Company, AT&T, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), Staples and the U.S. Marine Corps.
Newton was named Green Commercial of the Year in the electric vehicle section of Fleet Transport magazine’s Irish Truck of the Year Awards 2010, sponsored by Castrol.
, the Newton is sold worldwide and available with three different payload capacities from . The lithium-ion battery pack is available in varying sizes that deliver a range from and a top speed of . Pricing starts at .
In March 2012 Smith announced the release of the Newton Step-Van, an all-electric, zero-emission vehicle built on the versatile Newton platform that features a walk-in body produced by Indiana-based Utilimaster.
The Smith Edison was the world’s first electric van with a Gross Vehicle Weight of under 3,500 kg – a critical factor because vehicles over 3,500 kg require a commercial vehicle driving licence. Edison, like any normal van under 3,500 kg, can be driven by anyone with a regular UK licence.
The Smith Edison was sold worldwide except in the U.S. The Smith Edison was available as a chassis cab, delivery van and minibus, with payload capacity varying from . The cargo van model started at and the minibus at . The delivery van was sold with different lithium-ion battery packs that deliver ranges from 55 to 100 mi / 90 to 160 km, with a top speed of .
The Smith Edison was based on the Ford Transit chassis and powered by a 90 kW induction motor from Enova Systems and a 40kWh or 51kWh Lithium-Ion Iron Phosphate battery pack from Valence Technology.
In November 2009, Smith Edison was named in the top five Vans of the Year by the Irish Motoring Writers Association. In December 2009 Edison was named Eco Van of the Year 2010 by What Van magazine.
In 2012 the Smith Edison was upgraded to use the Ford Transit Stage 5 variant. Customers span the world including Russia (Revolta), Netherlands (Spijkstaal), Taiwan (Taikang), Hong Kong (CLP, FedEx), UK, Sweden (FuelReduce) and Abu Dhabi.
The Smith Edison was discontinued in 2014.
LTI and Smith produced an all-electric version of LTI's TX4 black cab, branded the TX4E. Smith built the first 10 TX4E taxis under the UK Government’s Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator Programme.
The vehicles were not a commercial success. There has been some debate over the efficacy of an electric taxi. Bob Oddy, the general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association was quoted saying that "only about 40 percent of London cabbies will be able to work a full eight-hour shift on a 100-mile charge."
The Smith Ampere was based on the Ford Transit Connect chassis. Smith produced a European prototype in 2008 and a US version the following year, after Smith US signed a deal with Ford Motor Company in February 2009.
The van was to be assembled for the North American market in the former Trans World Airlines overhaul hangar at Kansas City International Airport in Kansas City, Missouri in the United States and also in the UK for the European market.
However the company terminated this project, by mutual agreement with Ford in November 2009. Smith cited the unexpected early success of its Newton all-electric truck in the US market; Smith US already had an order book for 255 units and therefore decided to focus its resources on the Newton product.
Also in February 2009, Smith US announced it was partnering with Humvee manufacturer AM General to produce a prototype electric delivery vehicle for the United States Postal Service.
Ford subsequently partnered with powertrain company Azure Dynamics to produce the electric Transit Connect. Ironically, Azure then selected AM General to facilitate the vehicle integration work on this project.
However, in 2010, but Ford later announced it would partner with Azure Dynamics Corporation instead.
Smith Electric Vehicles is developing new drive line enhancements and ancillary systems for commercial electric vehicles, including heating and air conditioning. The company estimates the new technology could increase electric vehicle range by up to 20%.
In February 2010, Smith announced it was working with Proton Power Systems Plc of Germany, to incorporate a hydrogen fuel cell into its Smith Newton vehicle. The small fuel cell will act as a mini-generator, topping up the traction batteries and increasing vehicle range by up to 100%.
SmithLink was born out of a desire to understand how a fleet of all electric vehicles perform under many varying conditions (topology, temperature and driver style to name a few). In 2010 a small team was formed to design a system that would allow the collection and processing of key data to aid prognostics and continual product development. 
SmithLink was established in 2009 and was rolled out to a few key UK and US fleets in 2010.
When SmithLink first started out there wasn't a secure and reliable transmission protocol for high volume data transmission over public networks (the data portions of the mobile GPRS spectrum). Smith worked with the AMQP Working Group and OASIS to define a new messaging protocol with an aim to make it the standard protocol for messaging interoperability. SmithLink was one of the first heavy users of theAMQP protocol for telemetry transmission.
By 2014 this system has been installed in over 800 vehicles around the world and in March 2014 the SmithLink had recoded over of 8.5 million miles of data for all electric trucks.
Tanfield announced the formation of Smith Electric Vehicles US Corp (Smith US) in February 2009 and the company opened for business later that year. It has since grown to become America’s leading manufacturer of electric trucks.
Tanfied owns 49% of Smith US. The remaining 51% is in the hands of private investors.
Being majority-owned by US investors means that Smith US qualifies for the significant funding and incentive opportunities for electric trucks, which are available at both State and Federal level.
Smith US owns the exclusive rights to produce and market Tanfield’s commercial electric vehicles under the Smith brand. Tanfield licencese its electric vehicle technology to Smith, in exchange for a royalty fee per vehicle sold by Smith US.
Smith US produces the Smith Newton all-electric truck, in Classes 3 - 7. The Newton has a top speed of , a range of up to on a single charge and is powered by lithium-ion batteries.
In July 2009, Smith US delivered its first Smith Newton trucks, at a ceremony on Capitol Hill, presided over by Missouri Senator Kit Bond. The first six customers were Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay, AT&T, Staples, Pacific Gas & Electric and Kansas City Power & Light.
These initial six vehicles were produced at Smith UK’s facility in Washington, Tyne & Wear and shipped to Missouri in kit form, for final assembly. However, by October, Smith US had recruited and trained the nucleus of its own workforce; Newton trucks started rolling off the production line in Kansas City.
In July 2009, the Department of Energy awarded $10m to Smith US, to facilitate a fleet of trial vehicles for major US corporations. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke made the grant award announcement in Kansas City, while on a visit to Smith US customer Kansas City Power & Light.
In January 2010, the Smith Newton became the first ever all-electric truck on the US General Services Administration (GSA) schedule. The schedule is a list of products approved for purchase by all Federal agencies and the US military. These agencies spend a combined $1 billion every year on GSA-approved vehicles and automotive services.
Right at the end of March 2010, Smith US received further validation from the Obama administration. US Senator Claire McCaskill announced that the DOE was awarding an additional $22m, allowing Smith US to increase its build program to in excess of 500 Smith Newton trucks.
Smith has its corporate headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. The company also has its engineering centre of excellence in Washington, Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom
Smith US launched a bid to buy out the Smith UK operation, in order to create a totally separate company to Tanfield.
Smith US made a £37m conditional offer, equating to 50p per Tanfield share, plus a "free" share in Smith US if it subsequently undergoes an IPO and joins the stock market in the near future. Tanfield granted Smith US a four-month period of exclusivity, giving the American company until July to raise the requisite funding and table a firm offer. Following Obama's visit to the Kansas City plant on July 8, the exclusivity was extended another 60 days to September 2010.

<doc id="15113991" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15113991" title="Heytesbury Pty. Ltd.">
Heytesbury Pty. Ltd.

Heytesbury Pty. Ltd. is the privately owned company of the Holmes à Court family in Western Australia.
Originally called Heytesbury Holdings, the company was formed by Robert Holmes à Court in the 1970s as the holding company of his rapidly expanding financial empire. After the sale of its interests in Bell Group and Bell Resources in 1988, Heytesbury became an active private investment vehicle, acquiring Stoll Moss Theatres and Sherwin Pastoral Co, and investing in companies such as Jaguar Cars, Christie's, Standard Chartered Bank and U.S. Steel.
Following the death of Robert Holmes à Court in 1990, his widow Janet Holmes à Court took over the management of Heytesbury. Over the next decade a number of assets were sold to reduce the company's large debt load, including the Stoll Moss Group, a number of cattle stations in Northern Australia, and the John Holland Group (which had been purchased after Robert's death).
In 2000, the eldest son, Peter Holmes à Court, elected to sell his one-sixth share of Heytesbury to pursue his own interests. Robert Holmes à Court, died intestate (without a will), leaving his wife one third of the family fortune with the four children getting the other two thirds. The amount Peter received was reported as A$35 million.
Shortly afterwards, in 2000, Paul Holmes à Court, the youngest son of Robert and Janet Holmes à Court took over the management of Heytesbury. In the same year, Peter Holmes à Court was appointed to the position of chief executive officer of the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) and was responsible for re-listing AACo on the Australian Stock Exchange. This set Peter up in direct competition with the family, since the primary business of both Heytesbury and AACo was cattle.
In 2008, Paul bought out his other family shareholders and took sole ownership of the company.
Heytesbury now owns a number of large cattle stations in Northern Australia (including the famous Victoria River Downs), Vasse Felix (Margaret River's first winery) and the thoroughbred stud Heytesbury Stud near Perth. Vasse Felix has established itself as a strong wine brand in Australia.

CVS Ferrari

CVS Ferrari dates back to the 1940s, when it was previously known as THE FERRARI BELOTTI S.p.A. Belotti was the first company to design and build mobile handling equipment specifically for ports from their manufacturing facility on "Ponte Canepa" wharf.
In July 2002 CVS bought Belotti.
In 1952 Belotti manufactured the first crane able to lift and transport military aircraft. In 1967 Belotti introduced the first container handling straddle carrier with side lifting capability.
The first 100-tonne capacity aircraft transporter was supplied in 1967. Belotti later delivered machines to armed forces worldwide. Belotti ultimately supplied over 1,200 machines worldwide.
1973 – The company is founded as manufacturer of crane carriers and special vehicles
1982 – Terminal and ro-ro tractors are manufactured
1990 – The company enters in container handling manufacturing with its first Top Loader
1993 – First family of reachstacker model Ferrari 100 are launched
1997 – The second generation of reach stackers model Ferrari 200 is introduced in the market
2001 – Alliances with Taylor and Komatsu are signed to become global manufacturer of reach stackers
2002 – Acquisition of the Belotti

<doc id="15114174" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15114174" title="IJM Corporation">
IJM Corporation

IJM Corporation Berhad () is one of Malaysia's leading conglomerates and is listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Securities"). Its core business activities encompass construction, property development, manufacturing and quarrying, infrastructure concessions and plantations. Headquartered in Selangor, Malaysia, IJM's regional aspirations have seen it establish a growing presence in neighboring developing markets with operations presently spanning 10 countries, with primary focus in Malaysia, India, United Arab Emirates, China and Indonesia. IJM's phenomenal growth over the past three decades has been the result of its unwavering focus on its core competencies, diversification into strategically related businesses and selective expansion into new markets.
The result of a merger between three medium-sized local construction companies - IGB Construction Sdn Bhd, Jurutama Sdn Bhd and Mudajaya Sdn Bhd, IJM was formed in 1983 to compete more effectively against bigger foreign rivals. The Company began to quickly establish itself as a professionally managed construction group and rapidly gained market acceptance. Over the years, the Company progressively built on its delivery capabilities, competitive prowess and financial capacity to strengthen its footing as a reputable local contractor.
In April 2007, IJM acquired the Road Builder Group ("RBH"), its nearest competitor, to augment its position as one of the country's biggest builders. In addition to bolstering its construction order book, property land bank and infrastructure portfolio, the enlarged Group enabled IJM to attain considerable synergistic benefits, greater local prominence as well as attain a more sizable balance sheet to bid for larger jobs and facilitate its expansion into overseas markets.
IJM's undertaking as a property developer began as a natural progression from its experience in the construction business. The Group's property arm has since grown considerably. IJM Land Berhad is one of the largest property developers in Malaysia with sprawling townships, commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums under development in key growth areas throughout the country. Besides establishing itself as a reputable township developer in India, IJM has also successfully undertaken ventures overseas in the past such as in Orlando USA, Singapore and Australia.
Initially supporting in-house needs, the Group's Industry Division quickly grew its operations into scale-able core activities focused on catering to demand from outside the Group. IJM continued to expand on its operations in this division with strategic acquisitions such as the takeover of Industrial Concrete Products Berhad in 2004 and successful market diversifications into China, India and Pakistan.
Leveraging on its construction expertise, the Group also owns and operates infrastructure concessions to create long-term recurrent income streams. Initial advancements into concession assets in Malaysia, however, proved elusive and, thus, an international focus was adopted. IJM's involvement in overseas infrastructure privatization (Build-Operate-Transfer) schemes met with considerable success. Amongst the Group's present investments in major overseas infrastructure projects are the Western Access Tollway in Argentina, five tolled highways and the Gautami power plant in India, and the Binh An water treatment concession in Vietnam. In Malaysia, the Group owns and operates three highways and port concessions from the RBH merger. The Group had previously invested in and profitably sold several infrastructure assets in China.
The Group also ventured into oil palm plantations in 1985 as a source of steady income to cushion the cyclical nature of its core construction business. This investment has since paid off handsomely. Now listed on the Main Market of Bursa Securities, IJM Plantations Berhad has contributed significantly to the Group's earnings over the years and has also accorded the Group better resilience to weather macro-economic and input costs volatilities. It is currently expanding its plantation operations into Indonesia.
When IJM went public in 1986, it had a market capitalization of RM66 million and total assets of RM172 million. The Group's market capitalization stood at RM9.83 billion as of 30 June 2014 and total assets stood at RM18.4 billion as of 31 March 2014.
I → IGB Construction Sdn Bhd was incorporated in 1981
J → Jurutama Sdn Bhd was incorporated in 1970 as Soon Tat Construction Sdn Bhd
M → Mudajaya Construction Sdn Bhd was incorporated in 1965 as Chye Hin Construction Co Ltd
The founders of Jurutama and Mudajaya were professionals serving as senior government officials. Despite holding secure positions, their determination to search for that legendary 'pot of gold at the end of the rainbow' led them to break new grounds at a time when hardly any qualified engineer dared venture out as contractor.
With them at the helm, they steered Jurutama and Mudajaya through the high risk contracting business. With their perseverance and diligence to give their best, they brought new changes and professionalism to the entire Malaysian construction industry. And, by the end of the '70s, Jurutama and Mudajaya have emerged as two of the largest companies in Malaysia.
Tough times set in at the turn of the decade when the influx of large and well-capitalised foreign contractors, who had with them surplus capacity and concessionary government loans, severely affected the competitiveness of local construction companies. Local contractors were slowly being relegated to being subcontractors or minority joint venture partners.
Jurutama and Mudajaya were not spared. Their founders saw the obvious. Local companies have got to either merge, go public or come under the umbrella of larger public companies if they are to survive the challenges posed by these foreign contractors.
A meeting of former Technical College mates brought the answer. IGB Corporation Bhd, a public listed property company which then owned a small building construction subsidiary, saw the synergies that a combination of IGB Construction, Jurutama and Mudajaya could bring to the Group. In 1982, in a friendly takeover, IGB Corporation Bhd acquired all the shares in Jurutama and Mudajaya.
Following this acquisition, Solidstate Sdn Bhd was incorporated (1983) and, in 1984, the name was changed to IJM Engineering and Construction Sdn Bhd. IGB then transferred all its equity interests in Jurutama and Mudajaya together with that of IGB Construction in exchange for shares in this newly incorporated company. IJM had thus become IGB's holding company for its construction interests.
In 1986, IJM turned public. An application made for its shares to be listed on the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad was subsequently obtained in September 1986.
To better reflect the Group's diversified nature of activities, the present logo and a new name, IJM Corporation Berhad, was adopted in 1989.

<doc id="15116338" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15116338" title="Egan-Jones Ratings Company">
Egan-Jones Ratings Company

Egan-Jones Ratings Company, also known as EJR, was founded in 1995 and actively rates the credit worthiness of approximately 2000+ high yield and high grade U.S. corporate debt issuers. Egan-Jones positions itself as unique among nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) for being wholly investor-supported, a structure designed to minimize the potential for conflicts of interest in assessing credit quality. The firm was granted NRSRO status on December 21, 2007, making it the ninth such organization to be recognized by the SEC.
The effectiveness of Egan-Jones' investor-supported credit ratings has been measured by third parties, including Richard D. Johnson of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, the Stanford University Business School and the University of Michigan's Business School.
Sean Egan, principal of Egan-Jones Rating, appeared before Congress on October 22, 2008 and argued that issuers of complex securities "shopped" for ratings which resulted in a race to the bottom in terms of credit transparency. Rather than "beat up Moody's and S&P for behavior" they'd been financially motivated to pursue, the government needs to support a new business model paid for by investors, not issuers, to support the funding ecosystem which has so severely broken down, he asserted.
Egan-Jones on July 16, 2011, became the first NRSRO to cut its rating on the United States from AAA to AA+.
On April 5, 2012, Egan-Jones downgraded the credit ranking of the United States for the second time (and within one year) from AA+ (Excellent) to AA (Very Good) assuming that the debt will reach $16.7 trillion by the end of 2012 while the GDP will not grow further $15.7 trillion limit and the debt to the GDP ratio will reach 112% of the national GDP which is the highest level since the WW II. On September 14, 2012, Egan-Jones downgraded the credit rating of the United States for the third time from AA to AA-, the lowest of what is considered "high grade", as a reaction to QE3.
Egan-Jones was also the first to downgrade WorldCom and Enron.
The SEC warned Egan-Jones in October 2011 of a possible enforcement action. On April 24, 2012, the SEC charged Sean Egan with numerous offenses including: making false and misleading statements in the firm's application to become a Nationally Recognized Rating Agency, violations of conflicts-of-interest and record keeping, and falsely stating that he was unaware if his paid clients were long or short specific securities that Egan-Jones rated. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued charges against the company, and its founder, Sean Egan, for "material misrepresentations and omissions in the company’s July 2008 application to register as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) for issuers of asset-backed securities (ABS) and government securities" as well as "material misrepresentations in other submissions furnished to the SEC and violations of record-keeping and conflict-of-interest provisions governing NRSROs."
The SEC alleged that among other violations EJR "allowed two analysts to participate in determining the credit ratings for issuers whose securities they owned", and "EJR also (1) failed to make or retain a record of the procedures and methodologies it used to determine credit ratings".
Egan has stated, "Our job is to get back to work and focus on providing timely, accurate ratings and research. This will not have any effect on the firm's independence or our commitment to call credit quality as we see it, regardless of issuer." Alan Futerfas, the firm's lawyer, has denied the allegations stating that "it’s clear the SEC has a bias against independent firms" noting that the SEC was using "hyper-technical" claims and that "these filings, new forms started in 2007, are subject to significant interpretation," and that "the firm used good faith and answered [questions on the forms] as best as it could." Futerfas noted that "not one word in the [SEC's order] questions the quality, integrity and timeliness of the Egan-Jones ratings" and criticized the SEC for failing to take action against major NSROs which had "inflated their structured debt, rated junk AAA, and brought down the American economy, according to Congressional reports." The SEC has not responded to Futerfas's remarks.
On Jan. 22, 2013 the SEC announced that Egan-Jones has agreed to settle charges that they made willful and material misstatements and omissions when registering to become a NRSRO for asset-backed and government securities.

Alliance for School Choice

The Alliance for School Choice is the largest organization in the United States promoting school choice programs. The Alliance for School choice supports the creation and expansion of school voucher, corporate tax credit, and other school choice programs. The organization is headquartered in Washington, DC, is designated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and receives its funding through private individual and foundation donations.
The Alliance for School Choice was launched on May 17, 2004, the fiftieth anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education, with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. The formation of the Alliance for School Choice represented the merger of three organizations: the American Education Reform Council, Children First America, and the American Education Reform Foundation. Clint Bolick, who was part of the legal team that argued the Zelman v. Simmons-Harris school voucher case before the U.S. Supreme Court, was appointed as the Alliance's first president in 2004. Bolick resigned his position at the Alliance in 2007 to take a new post at the Arizona-based Goldwater Institute. On January 16, 2007, the Alliance's board of directors announced the appointment of Charles R. Hokanson, Jr., a former official at the U.S. Department of Education, as the organization's new president. Hokanson became president of the organization in April 2007 and the organization subsequently moved its headquarters to Washington, DC. In November 2008, Hokanson left the organization and was replaced by the organization's chief of staff, John Schilling, who serves as interim president.
The Alliance shares offices, staff and resources with Advocates for School Choice, which is a 501(c)(4) organization that promotes the benefits of school choice programs.
Alliance activities include assisting affiliate organizations in states, hosting informational events, working with parent activists and community leaders to enact and implement state programs, and publishing two magazines, the "School Choice Digest" and the "Activist." The Alliance has also engaged in litigation efforts on behalf of parents. In October 2008, the Alliance announced the development of a new campaign designed to recruit 10,000 supporters of school choice. Individuals who registered on their site received free bumper stickers and magazine subscriptions. www.letparentschoose.org

Monitor Deloitte

Monitor Deloitte is the multinational strategy consulting practice of Deloitte Consulting LLP. Monitor Deloitte specializes in providing strategy consultation services to the senior management of major organizations and governments. It helps its clients address a variety of management areas, including: Corporate & Business Unit Strategy, Digital Strategy, Demand Analytics, Innovation, Organization and Leadership, Economic Development and Security, Marketing, Pricing & Profitability.
Prior to its acquisition by Deloitte in January 2013, Monitor Deloitte was an American strategy consulting practice known as Monitor Group. Monitor Group was founded in 1983 by six entrepreneurs with ties to the Harvard Business School, including Michael Porter. The advisory services now offered by Monitor Deloitte are in line with Monitor Group's legacy expertise, but expanded to a broader set of implementation and capabilities design focused on greater resilience to economic uncertainty.
Today, Monitor Deloitte is a distinct market-facing strategy and business transformation practice. It is led by Bansi Nigja who is a principal of Deloitte Consulting LLP. Prior to the merger with Deloitte, Bansi Nigja was President of Monitor Group and led the firm’s global innovation practice.
Monitor Group was founded in 1983 by six entrepreneurs with ties to Harvard Business School, including Michael Porter, Mark B. Fuller, and Joseph B. Fuller.
In 2008, the Corporation for National and Community Service honored Monitor for outstanding pro bono service for its 10-year partnership with and providing consulting resources for New Profit Inc., a national venture philanthropy fund, as well as its consulting work through Monitor Institute. More than 250 Monitor Group consultants have participated in projects supporting New Profit and its portfolio organizations.
Monitor was hit by the 2008 economic crisis. The company laid off nearly 20% of its workforce and closed several small offices. According to co-founder Joe Fuller, 2008 revenue was up on the previous year, but he stated that Monitor continued to anticipate "a demanding and tough market in the short term". Monitor also operated a research captive called Grail Research which was sold to Integreon in 2010, which is a member company of the Ayala Corporation
On November 7, 2012, Monitor's US subsidiary filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and it was announced that Deloitte had agreed to acquire Monitor Group. The company was officially bought out by Deloitte on January 11, 2013. "The new combined practices will operate under the Monitor Deloitte brand, resulting in a new global presence in strategy consulting", according to the Monitor website in February 2013.
Monitor was based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has 27 offices in 17 countries. Monitor's consulting areas included: Strategy and Uncertainty, Leadership and Organization, Innovation, Economic Development, Marketing Pricing and Sales, and Social Action. Monitor had a number of business units that specialize in these areas and work together on client projects and the development of intellectual property, including its own white papers and research reports. They included: Global Business Network (GBN), experts in scenario planning and experiential learning; Doblin specializes in innovation and design thinking; Monitor Regional Competitiveness supported economic development and regional competitiveness initiatives; Monitor Institute consulted on strategy for the philanthropy and non-profit sectors; Monitor 360 works on strategy for government and non-governmental agencies; and Monitor Talent, a network of authors, experts, and academics who shared ideas about the future of business, science and society. According to Monitor Group, about 85 percent of its revenues came from repeat clients.
Monitor Group did not disclose its list of clients. Even when discussing clients in-house, Monitor used acronyms to protect client's identities, a mark of Monitor's hyper-confidentiality. Some engagements that have appeared in the press due to their public nature include a major initiative with the Libyan government and an organizational effort with the University of California.
Monitor Group recruited both at MBA and undergraduate levels, including online recruiting, for the "consultant" position, the title given to all of Monitor's professional staff. Monitor's candidates typically come from top Ivy League schools and their international equivalents, liberal arts colleges and business schools across the world. Only around 2% of the undergraduate applicant pool received offers.
Several authors affiliated with the firm have written business consulting books related to Monitor's work, including "Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors", by Michael Porter; "Knowledge for Action: A Guide to Overcoming Barriers to Organizational Change", by Chris Argyris; "A Theory of the Firm: Governance, Residual Claims and Organizational Forms", by Michael C. Jensen; "The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably", by Thomas T. Nagle, John E. Hogan and Joseph Zale; and "The Art of the Long View: Paths to Strategic Insight for Yourself and Your Company" by Peter Schwartz.
Monitor was first hired by the Muammar Gaddafi-led Libyan government in 2005 to assess the state of Libya’s economy, develop plans for economic modernization and reform of the banking system, and train leaders from different sectors of society. The work did not involve any wider political reforms in the North African nation. According to a 2007 memo from Monitor to Libya's intelligence chief which was subsequently obtained by the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition and posted on the internet in 2009, Monitor entered into further contracts with the Libyan regime in 2006 which were worth at least $3m (£1.8m) per year plus expenses. According to the memo these contracts were for a campaign to "enhance international understanding and appreciation of Libya... emphasize the emergence of the new Libya... [and] introduce Muammar Qadhafi as a thinker and intellectual." In connection with these contracts Monitor engaged and flew to Libya several leading Western academics, including Anthony Giddens of the London School of Economics (LSE), Joseph Nye of Harvard’s Kennedy School, Benjamin Barber of Rutgers University and Michael Porter. Monitor also provided research support for a doctoral thesis which Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, submitted to the LSE. During this period Monitor also proposed a separate project to write a book for a fee of $2.45 million, to be published in Gaddafi's name and which would "allow the reader to hear Gaddafi elaborate, in his own words and in conversation with renowned international experts, his core ideas on individual freedom, direct democracy vs. representative democracy, [and] the role of state and religion". The book was never completed and Monitor later stated that the project had been a "serious mistake on our part".
Monitor's work for the Libyan government, and its hiring of academics in connection with it, became the subject of increasing scrutiny and controversy after Gaddafi’s forces attacked anti-government protesters in February 2011. Questions arose about whether Monitor should have registered as a foreign lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) in connection with its work in Libya. During this time details also came to public notice of the role which Monitor had played in the writing of Saif Gaddafi's thesis submitted to the LSE. This, combined with public exposure of wider connections between the LSE and Libya, resulted in the resignation of its director, Howard Davies. In March 2011, Monitor announced that it had launched an internal investigation into its work for the Libyan government. In May 2011, Monitor announced it would register some of its past work in Libya with the U.S. Department of Justice in accordance with FARA. Around the same time, Mark Fuller, Monitor Group's founder, chairman, and CEO, announced his resignation, which, according to Monitor executives, had been planned for several months. The company said it would also register for work with Jordan.

Gezira Sporting Club

The Gezira Sporting Club (, transliteration:"nādī al-ǧazyrah al-reyādī") is the largest multi-sport facility in Egypt. It was founded in 1882 and was originally called Khedivial Sporting Club. It is located on the island of Zamalek in Cairo.
The grounds of the Gezira Sporting Club were initially carved out of the "Khedivial Botanical Gardens", and as a result acacias and gardens continue to decorate the area. After the land had been formally leased to the British military command in 1882, club rules were licensed and the land was divided into several recreational playing grounds. At first, the club was for the exclusive use of the British Army.
Membership was restricted to applicants elected by the committee, on the recommendation of two members, although British army officers were automatically enrolled. There were about 750 members. The entrance fee was E£ 2. The various subscriptions were as follows:
Guests could visit the club whenever accompanied by those members by purchasing Day Passes for 5 piastres.
In 1906, the club members asked the Egyptian government for ownership, but their request was refused. Instead, they were granted a 60-year lease.
The exclusive character of the club continued until after World War II. In January 1952, the club was nationalized and became a public club. By this point, most members of the Gezira Sporting Club were Egyptians, but the club's members were from society's elite. As a result of nationalization, the ethos and structure of the club were to be altered during the Nasser regime. Half of its eighteen-hole golf course were given over to a youth club built by the Egyptian government on the club premises (making it a nine-hole course). Much of what was deemed as a traditionally aristocratic asset was nationalized for the benefit of the poorer majority. These actions made the Egyptian president at the time, Gamal Abdel Nasser, loved and popular among the middle and lower classes of Egypt.
During Anwar Al Sadat's presidency, a new elevated highway (the 6th October Bridge) was built over the remaining nine-hole golf course and six-furlong racecourse causing the size of the club to further erode.
Despite suffering vandalism, the Gezira Sporting Club still offers most of the sports and games practiced by its founders: golf, tennis, squash, croquet, horse riding and cricket.
What had started as a British military club evolved into one of Egypt's greatest outdoor attractions. Over the next five decades Gezira Sporting Club remained both a landmark and one of Cairo's greatest assets continuing to this day.
As of 2012, membership was estimated to consist of 43,000 families.
The 125-year-old par 70 golf course was the first in Egypt, and was once its best. Before the Nasser Era, it was an 18-hole course used only by British nationals.
Since 1907, Gezira Sporting Club has been the official home of Egypt's lawn tennis with open tournaments and championships regularly held on its clay courts. From 1925, international celebrities took part in these widely attended events.
Despite the launch of the Egyptian Lawn Tennis Association Championship in 1934, Gezira Sporting Club continued to offer its two cups:
The Gezira swimming team was founded in the early 20th century. Now is one of the stronger swimming teams in the Egyptian Premier National Championships. It is ranked 13th out of 33 clubs.
There are currently around forty sports played in Gezira Sporting Club. Some are:
Like other large clubs in Egypt, the Gezira Sporting Club is currently in the process of building another branch. The planned location is in the 6th of October City. The club had signed a contract for of land and construction has started.

Lubrizol

The Lubrizol Corporation is a provider of specialty chemicals for the transportation, industrial and consumer markets. These products include additives for engine oils and other transportation-related fluids, additives for industrial lubricants, and additives for gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Lubrizol makes ingredients and additives for personal care products, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, specialty materials, including plastics technology, and coatings in the form of specialty resins and additives.
Lubrizol is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway and is headquartered in Wickliffe, Ohio. The company generated $7 billion in revenue in 2015 and has an employee headcount of 9,000 people globally. Eric R. Schnur is the current president, chairman and CEO.
The Lubrizol Corporation was founded in 1928 as The Graphite Oil Products Company in Cleveland, Ohio, by father Frank A. Nason and son Francis A. "Alex" Nason, Thomas W. James and brothers Kent H. Smith, Vincent K. Smith and A. Kelvin Smith. The company's first product was a graphite lubricant and applicator for early automobiles. In 1929, the company changed its name to The Lubri-Graph Corporation. It moved to Wickliffe, Ohio in 1931. In 1934, Lubri-Graph changed its name to The Lubri-Zol Corporation. The name changed to Lubrizol in 1943.
The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1960s. Toward the end of that decade, Lubrizol focused on developing products to help make cars cleaner and more fuel efficient. During the 1980s, the company created new additives for passenger motor oils, gear oils, hydraulic fluids and viscosity modifiers, while also eyeing biotechnology, agribusiness and specialty chemicals for other applications to expand beyond the transportation field.
Lubrizol acquired Noveon International in 2004 for 920 million in cash and the assumption of 920 million in debt. That move, along with others, helped Lubrizol expand beyond its additives business and create a second business segment, Lubrizol Advanced Materials, producing industrial chemicals for packaging, paints and textiles, chemicals for personal-care products such as lotions and shampoos, and additives and ingredients for engineered polymers, in addition to products for the medical devices and pharmaceutical markets.
Berkshire Hathaway announced on March 14th 2011 that it would acquire Lubrizol for 9.7 billion in cash. This happened just weeks after a top Berkshire executive, David Sokol, made a major bet on the stock price with his own money. That deal closed in September 2011. In December 2014, Lubrizol bought Weatherford International's engineered chemistry and drilling fluids businesses in a deal valued at 825 million. This resulted in creation of the company's third business segment, Lubrizol Oilfield Solutions.
The company announced that it the eliminated Lubrizol Oilfield Operations business segment in February 2017.
The Lubrizol Corporation is broken down into two business segments, Lubrizol Additives and Lubrizol Advanced Materials.
With Lubrizol Additives, the company supplies additives for transportation, including additives for lubricating engine oils, fuels and other chemicals, and industrial lubricants.
Lubrizol Advanced Materials creates and sells specialty materials and chemicals used in consumer products for personal care, pharmaceutical and food industries; specialty materials under the TempRite, Hycar and Estane trademarks; and performance coatings under the trademarks Hycar, Sancure, Algan, Performax and Myflam.
Lubrizol had operated Lubrizol Oilfield Solutions, an oilfield chemicals and drilling fluids business, following the 2014 acquisition of Weatherford International businesses. "Bloomberg" reported in February 2017 that Lubrizol eliminated the oilfield solutions business segment.
Lubrizol has grown its business through a number of acquisitions and partnerships in recent years. Among them:

<doc id="15135049" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15135049" title="Evil Angel (studio)">
Evil Angel (studio)

Evil Angel is an American production company and distributor of pornographic films, founded and owned by John Stagliano.
Stagliano and Evil Angel pioneered the Gonzo pornography genre in the late 1980s. Several of the most acclaimed pornographic film directors have worked for Evil Angel, and its films have won numerous awards.
It has been described as "the top porn-film producer" in the U.S, as one of the handful of companies which dominate the distribution of hardcore pornographic films in the U.S., and as one of the most profitable porn studios.
The company's rise to prominence was fueled by the industry switch from film to videotape. In the late 1970s a feature-length porn film shot on celluloid might have cost as much as $350,000. In 1983 the VCR had been recently introduced, and producers were beginning to make pornographic films on videotape. A film using video could be made for as little as $5,000, compared to a minimum of $40,000 for a movie shot on film. Into the 1990s, by shooting its productions with video cameras, Evil Angel could still make films for $8,000. Stagliano initially had little knowledge of film making, but he made his first movie for $8,000 in 1983: "Bouncing Buns", starring Stacy Donovan. For the next six years he made films for other companies to manufacture and distribute.
In 1989 he started Evil Angel, to sell his own films. The origin of the company's name goes back to when Stagliano was working as a stripper: "There was another guy in one of my shows named John. So this MC started calling me Evil John to differentiate us. This was when I was doing Dracula and chains. At the same time I had a girlfriend who called herself Angel when she did strip shows. She was a very nasty girl and I suggested that she call herself Evil Angel. She didn't, but I loved the name and wound up using it for my company."
The first Evil Angel film was "Dance Fire", filmed in 1988 by Stagliano, starring himself, Trinity Loren, Brandy Alexandre and others. It would only be released on DVD 20 years later. Influenced by amateur pornography, In 1989 Stagliano hit on the idea of performing in a film whilst also operating the camera, so that the viewer experiences the film through the eyes of his character. The first-person perspective was influenced by the 1960s film "Blowup". At the time this was in contrast to the majority of porn, which tended not to make viewers aware of the camera. This technique is today known as Point of view pornography. He formed his "Buttman" persona, and shot "Adventures of Buttman". The early "Buttman" films were written, produced, directed, edited, shot and manufactured personally by Stagliano. The first two "Buttman" films had lengthy scripts, but the series soon evolved into an improvised, spontaneous format. In contrast to his earlier work and the standard porn of the time, Stagliano did not link each scene together to form a conventional narrative. At times the camerawork was shaky. Partly due to his lack of funds, he didn't use elaborate sets or locations. At the time porn films had a traditional storyline, with sex scenes interspersed with dialogue by performers with little acting ability. Instead of that format, Stagliano chose to film "one sex scene which has a beginning, a middle and ends at a climax. Trying to make all that relate to a bigger story is very difficult and creates all sorts of problems that get in the way of making the best scene possible." The distinct style of the early Evil Angel films would be widely imitated, and would come to be known as Gonzo pornography.
In the 1990s Stagliano became one of the most successful figures in the American pornographic film industry. In 1990 Patrick Collins and Stagliano founded the Elegant Angel label as a subsidiary of Evil Angel. In 1991 Stagliano established a production subsidiary in São Paulo, Brazil. By 1993 the company was producing a new videotape every three weeks, and was grossing more than $1 million a year; in 1996 it sold approximately half a million videos. In the mid-'90s the company started using the phrase "The Evil Empire" on its box-covers, in reference to its growing stable of directors. In 1996 Collins established Elegant Angel as a separate company, and in 1998 it ended all cooperation with Evil Angel. His departure from Evil Angel has been called "less than amicable", and he and Stagliano are apparently "ex-friend[s]". At the time Collins said that Stagliano "couldn't run a business, and would fail without him". According to Stagliano, "Patrick's a bully . . . he wasn't doing his job properly . . . I should have fired him years ago".
A 1997 "U.S. News and World Report" investigation identified Evil Angel as the most profitable pornographic studio. In 2007 the studio received 127 AVN Award nominations in 60 categories, making it the fourth year in a row in which it received more than 100 nominations. In 2008 EA won 18 AVN awards. Stagliano won the 'Best Director - Video' award for "Fashionistas Safado: Berlin".
In August 2007, Evil Angel and Jules Jordan prevailed in a DVD piracy case against Kaytel Video Distribution and several other defendants, winning a total of over $17.5 million, which was the largest sum ever awarded in an adult piracy case. Evil were awarded $11.2 million, and Jordan $5.3 million. EA had originally filed the lawsuit in November 2005.
On April 8, 2008, Evil Angel and its owner, John Stagliano were indicted on Federal obscenity charges by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. Films named in the obscenity charges included "Storm Squirters 2" by Joey Silvera, "Milk Nymphos" by Jay Sin, and a trailer for "Belladonna: Fetish Fanatic 5". Stagliano and Evil Angel were represented by Al Gelbard, who successfully defended JM Productions owner Jeff Steward in a 2007 obscenity case. The company released a compilation DVD entitled "Defend Our Porn", with proceeds going towards its legal defense fund, and set up the DefendOurPorn.org website to provide information on the legal proceedings.
In December 2008 the BBC reported that Stagliano and Evil Angel were a client of UK lawyers Davenport Lyons who were seeking financial redress from people they asserted had downloaded copyright material using Peer to Peer software.
The company differs from most other porn studios in that it contracts with in-house directors and permits them to own the films that they create, while Evil Angel handles the film's manufacture, distribution, promotion and sales and takes a percentage of the gross sales. Each director has his own particular style and is a star in his own right, with his own brand identity. Stagliano adopted this business model due to his previous experience selling his videos to other companies. He found it difficult to establish his reputation when someone else owned his content, and he didn't receive any more money if a film sold well.
The company's roster of directors currently consists of Stagliano, John Leslie, Rocco Siffredi, Joey Silvera, Christoph Clark, Nacho Vidal, Jonni Darkko, Jake Malone, Jay Sin, Jazz Duro, Manuel Ferrara, Lexington Steele, Mike Adriano, Steve Holmes, Uncle D and Belladonna. Previous directors include Gregory Dark, Jules Jordan, Bruce Seven, Bionca, Alex de Renzy and Erik Everhard.
Gregory Dark left VCA over "creative differences" in the summer of 1995 and launched his own film company, Dark Works, with Evil Angel Video handling all distribution. His first film for Evil Angel was "Sex Freaks", starring Stephanie Swift, Nyrobi Knights, Lovette and Tom Byron. He also worked on "Snake Pit" and "The Best Of Gregory Dark". Dark has since stopped directing for the studio.
Jules Jordan formerly directed for Evil Angel, producing series including "Ass Worship". In 2006 he left to form his own company, Jules Jordan Video.
Erik Everhard also formerly worked with the company, after directing for Anabolic Video, Diabolic Video and Red Light District Video. He left Red Light District in 2005 to join Evil Angel, before joining Jules Jordan Video.
Stagliano has directed several film series for the studio. By 2003 almost 30 films in the "Buttman" series had been produced, some of them shot in locations including New Zealand, Prague (Czech Republic), San Diego and London. The premise of most of the films is Stagliano approaching a woman and persuading her to show him her buttocks, followed by her having sex. The films blurred the boundary between what was a pre-arranged set-up and what was real. It has also been turned into a comic-book.
John Leslie had a successful career as an actor, then began directing for VCA Pictures in the mid-'80s. The first film he directed for Evil Angel was "The Dog Walker" in 1994, after its script had been rejected by VCA. Rocco Siffredi began working as a director for the company in 1994.
Joey Silvera started directing for Evil Angel in 1995. Previously he had been an actor, then directed for Devil's Film in the early 1990s. Christoph Clark joined the company in 1997. His first film was "Euro Angels". Nacho Vidal joined the studio in late 2001. Jonni Darkko first directed for New Sensations. In 2004 he formed Darkko Productions and joined Evil Angel.
Manuel Ferrara released his first Evil Angel film in May 2006, after working for Red Light District Video for two years. He was originally a protégé of Rocco Siffredi, and had an award-winning acting career, including an appearance in Stagliano’s "Fashionistas". Jake Malone signed an exclusive distribution deal in June 2006. 
Belladonna was first introduced to Stagliano by her then-boyfriend Nacho Vidal. Evil Angel is the exclusive distributor of titles under the Belladonna Entertainment and Deadly Nightshade Productions labels. Jay Sin started directing for Buttman Magazine Choice in early 2007, working on films including "Milk Nymphos 2", then became an EA director in January 2008. 
Sin is known for his extreme anal pornography, more recently including rectal prolapse in some of his videos. Many of his videos also feature women inserting objects such as oranges and baseballs into their rectums, then pushing the objects back out. Sin calls his films "artistic" and states that porn for him is "a way of life"
Evil Angel Publishing is the magazine division of Evil Angel. In March 2007 it launched "Extra Parts", a 100-page publication featuring pictures from director Joey Silvera’s transgendered women movies.
The following is a selection of some of the major awards Evil Angel films have won:

Yoonew

yoonew, Inc. was a start-up based in New York City, USA, that ran an online exchange specializing in championship sports tickets and ticket derivatives. Since being founded in 2004, Yoonew provided tickets and ticket derivatives for large sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the World Series, the Stanley Cup, the UEFA European Football Championship, the Final Four and the US Open.
yoonew Inc. was founded in September 2004 by MIT Sloan students Gerry Wilson and Hagos Mehreteab in hopes of creating a method by which die-hard fans without thousands of dollars to spare could get their hands on cheap tickets to major sporting events. The idea was born when Wilson was unable to obtain affordable tickets to the 2003 World Series. After the idea fared well in a couple of business-plan competitions, Wilson and Mehreteab, a longtime friend, launched the company.
The company experienced difficulties early as co-founder Wilson was forced to liquidate his 401(k) in order to provide customers with 2005 NCAA Final Four college basketball tickets in 2005. After struggling initially, Yoonew was able to raise $2 million in investments and began to grow. In October 2007, yoonew changed its interface to provide real-time price plotting similar to that seen on Yahoo! and Google. A point of contention raised regarding the new interface was that it was too heavily geared towards traders, which reduces usability for the average user.
To make the site more accessible for the average user, yoonew launches on July 2008, "yoonew direct" a new interface in Adobe Flash which complements the existing interface ("yoonew exchange"). Users having an account on "yoonew exchange" can use the same account to log in yoonew direct and vice versa. In addition, products purchased on "yoonew direct" can be traded on the "yoonew exchange".
At the same time, yoonew launched a new feature which allows users to place orders for exact seat (defined by a section, row and seat) unlike the other events where users can only choose the seating category (usually five). At the moment, this feature is only available for the US Open 2008. This company is now out of business.
If a fan believes his favorite team will reach the championship game, he can purchase ticket futures months in advance at a low prices which are market-based. If the team actually makes it to the big game, the fan is guaranteed tickets. If the team is eliminated and the holder has not re-sold their contract, they lose their investment.
yoonew offers three types of contracts:
If Matchup Fantasy Seat are riskier than Team Fantasy Seat, they are also much cheaper.
During the playoff, the Fantasy Seats of eliminated teams get expired and are removed from their owner's portfolios. When a team becomes a finalist, the Team Fantasy Seat for the team is converted into a ticket. When both teams of a matchup become finalist, the Matchup Fantasy Seats are converted into tickets. The owners of such Fantasy Seats can choose either to sell the ticket on the exchange for a profit or keeps it to go to the game.
For example, in 2006, sports fan Joe Kocott bought 18 futures contracts for the Pittsburgh Steelers making the Super Bowl at an average of $185 each. When the Steelers eventually made it to the Super Bowl, he was delivered the tickets, which were selling at around $2,500 each at the time.
In 2007, a systems analyst paid $537 apiece for two futures contracts for the New England Patriots for upper-deck seats at University of Phoenix Stadium in Arizona. Since the Patriots made it to the Super Bowl, he ends up with two tickets for the Super Bowl XLII.
For Super Bowl XLII, a consumer could have had got a ticket for only $86 had he bought a team fantasy seat for the Giants one month before the big game.
More recently in 2008, Craig Cox, an Associate Professor at Texas Tech's School of Pharmacy bought two Matchup Fantasy Seats for the Steelers and Cardinals at the lower level for the Super Bowl XLIII for only $29.70 apiece one month before the NFL playoff. As both teams made it to the big game, he received two tickets and went to the game with his brother.
On the other hand, if a trader believes that a team will unlikely make it to the championship game, he can short the Fantasy Seat. To make sure that the short is covered, yoonew required that the trader owns a ticket. With one ticket to the Super Bowl for instance, the trader can short up to 16 Team Fantasy Seats (one for each team of the AFC conference or one for each team of the NFC conference). If the trader shorts a Team Fantasy Seat for a team which gets eliminated, she earns the amount at which she shorted the Fantasy Seat. However, in the "unfortunate" case the team makes it to the final, she loses her ticket.
On February 1, 2010 Yoonew ceased operations. Yoonew personally called its users on 1/31/2010 to make the announcement and notify customers that Yoonew would not be able to deliver Super Bowl 2010 tickets to customers who owned valid futures for that event. In the phone call, Yoonew indicated that they could not fulfill Super Bowl tickets because the macroeconomic crisis forced the bank responsible for its merchant account to go bankrupt and they had not paid Yoonew the money it was owed for its credit card deposits. Yoonew also indicated that they were currently in litigation with the The Ticket Reserve. In understanding that by not delivering the tickets to its customers that there would be no hope for repairing market confidence, Yoonew was forced to end its business. Yoonew promised to return the money its customers paid for their winning Super Bowl 2010 Fantasy Seats. On January 31, 2010 Yoonew decommissioned its forum and blog and directed all inquiries to service[at]yoonew.com.

<doc id="15145201" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15145201" title="National Testing Service">
National Testing Service

National Testing Service - Pakistan (NTS) is an organization in Pakistan that administers academic performance evaluation tests. It is similar to Educational Testing Service (ETS) in the United States. NTS offers two main types of tests, the "National Aptitude Test" (NAT) and the "Graduate Assessment Test" (GAT). NAT is aimed at students seeking admission to colleges and universities. GAT is aimed at graduates seeking admission to postgraduate education. NTS exams are also used to determine qualifications of students seeking advanced study abroad.
NTS is a Member of the International Association for Educational Assessment, USA (IAEA).It is also recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC). The NTS was developed to ensure quality educational standards in Pakistan and to "provide a national scale for comparative grading between institutes", consolidating examination boards under one administrating body. According to Shahid Siddiqui, director of The Centre for Humanities and Social Sciences at the Lahore School of Economics, tests implemented prior to the development of the NTS were criticized as not accommodating socio-cultural differences, resulting in a need for "an indigenous testing service that should design and develop testing materials within an indigenous context". Prominent Pakistani institutions like COMSATS Institute of Information Technology (CIIT), Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU) and Center for Advanced Studies in Engineering (CASE) have made it compulsory for students seeking admission to have cleared tests conducted by NTS.
Controversy erupted in 2007 following the mandating of NTS testing, first announced by Khalid Maqbool, Governor of Punjab, with regards to admission to universities and later set aside by the government unless the laws regarding university admission were amended. Criticism included allegations that the services were inconvenient to access and prohibitively expensive to economically challenged students. Maqbool called for input from the vice-chancellors of Punjab's public universities on 4 June. That year, each university department was permitted to set its own entrance requirements, with six of 64 departments at Punjab University electing to utilize tests from NTS. In October 2007, the vice-chancellor of Punjab University, Muhammad Arif Butt, endorsed the use of NTS testing in all departments of the university. NTS director Dr. Haroon Rasheed said that no tuition centres are associated with the service and NTS exams will not be out of course.
NTS has sought to establish a national educational standard for Pakistan but at the same time as an organization cannot and has not catered to the regionally diverse Pakistani nation. NTS resources are geographically restricted and both quantitatively and qualitatively limited. As stated by interface - an educational consultancy. Its contention as an independent NGO can also be challenged as it is affiliated with numerous regular testing centers of Comsats (as semi-Government body or inter-Governmental organization) & Public / Governmental education Institutions for their entrance / admission exams. 
A recent controversy of regular operational error has also arisen for Phd. assessment tests. The credibility / irresponsibility on the part of NTS officials has disqualified the candidates from applying in MPhil/PhD programs at public and private sector institutes because under HEC rules, they do not have any proof of clearing the test.
The overall process lacks credibility & transparency due to the un-disclosed nature of alternative processes for any participants, when they do not fall in the norms of the operating procedure (i.e. errors / loop holes) due to complexities that arise from multifarious of socioeconomic nature of challenges in present-day environment of Pakistan.
Unfortunately, the NTS management have even been caught and identified as plagiarizing test questions and are indirectly controlled by Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC).

RotoHog

RotoHog is the consumer facing Fantasy Sports website for Fastpoint Games, a digital platform developer that designs, implements and markets fantasy services for media and advertising partners. The company builds, delivers and manages co-branded fantasy sports games for major media companies, sports companies and professional sports leagues.
Their signature stock exchange game is a budget-based, high-roster-turnover style fantasy sports game that combines traditional fantasy scoring with a stock market-style trading floor for baseball, basketball, American football, and Association Football (soccer). The company also delivers traditional commissioner and pick-em style fantasy sports games.
RotoHog has also branched out to entertainment games with the Rose Ceremony game for the Reality TV show The Bachelor and the Us Weekly Celebrity Fantasy League.
RotoHog is also the provider of nba.com's NBA Stock Exchange and commissioner games and Brazilian media company Grupo RBS's first ever Fantasy Soccer game. In 2009, RotoHog began to provide games for Fox Sports en Español and the AVP Pro Beach Volleyball tour.
In June 2009, RotoHog closed a multi-year deal with Sporting News to power the sports media company's suite of fantasy sports games. Sporting News VP Jeff Gerttula commented, "In order to take our games to the next level, we wanted to align with somebody intensely focused on the space, was committed to a strong [business-to-business] solution, and wasn’t satisfied with developing the same old off-the-shelf products," 
In March 2010, RotoHog began powering the MySpace Bracket Challenge for the 2010 NCAA college basketball tournament. At the same time, the company announced that it would be launching its first commissioner-style baseball game on its own site.
Like most fantasy sports games, the core elements of RotoHog's flagship stock exchange game involve building a team and setting a line-up to earning points. To this traditional core game, RotoHog adds a liquid market for players that all team managers use to trade players. Players can be traded at almost any time and player prices reflect up-to-the minute supply and demand. This trading system removes many of the problems with unfair trades or collusion between managers that can occur in traditional fantasy games.
RotoHog also provides a social networking platform that allows users to compete in unlimited size leagues grouped by location, team allegiance, company affiliations, or local watering holes in addition to smaller traditional private leagues made up of a dozen or so friends. This social networking platform allows diverse groups to create custom leagues for their members. For example, the non-profit group "Hire-a-Hero" used RotoHog as a way to help military veterans connect with each other and transition back to civilian life. RotoHog have agreed to donate a portion of the advertisement revenue received from the Military Fantasy Football League (MFFL) to the "Hire-a-Hero" program. They have also decided to donate the $10 received for their premium statistical service, with which users can register to receive the latest news, injury reports and scouting reports from the site.
RotoHog has awarded various prizes include cash to the top teams in weekly, monthly and season long contests. The 2007 Baseball and Football champions won $100,000 each.
The owner of the second place Football team won $25,000, and third place $10,000. The remaining top 100 finishers also earned cash prizes.
RotoHog-specific game strategies used by some players include the following:
RotoHog differs from other fantasy sports games in several ways:
RotoHog differs from fantasy sports stock simulations in that the goal of the game is to score the most fantasy points by fielding the best team of players. Stock simulation games focus on increasing your portfolio value by anticipating price movements of players.
As a hybrid between traditional fantasy sports games and fantasy sports stock simulations, there are many predictable ways for team managers to increase their budgets through day trading. These managers can then assemble teams with essentially no budget constraint. This gives managers with the time to play the market a financial edge over managers who do not.
Sports Composite DE, Inc., the company that operates the RotoHog website, was founded by entrepreneur David Wu and Wharton Business School Professor Kent Smetters in 2006 and is based in Inglewood, California. Kelly Perdew, winner of The Apprentice Season 2, was named CEO in May 2008.
The company raised $6 million in its first venture round in August 2007. This funding was raised via DFJ DragonFund China and Mission Ventures, with additional investment coming from Allen & Co. and SCP Worldwide. StubHub, an online marketplace, co-founder Jeff Fluhr also invested in the online firm.
The company raised an additional $2 million in March 2009. The round was led by Mission Ventures and DFJ Dragon.
The company's board of directors includes Leo Spiegel of Mission Ventures and Andy Tang of DFJ DragonFund China.
Sports Composite DE, Inc. earns revenues from advertising and optional statistical packages. RotoHog leagues and competitions have been sponsored by ex-American football player Marshall Faulk and hall of fame baseball players Fred Lynn, Wade Boggs, and Ozzie Smith.
In December 2008, RotoHog along with domain name company, GoDaddy.com, launched an NFL Playoff Game on Facebook. RotoHog used the game to entice users to play other its other games, while GoDaddy used the game to gain exposure to the RotoHog and Facebook communities while supporting its Super Bowl ad campaign.
In April 2009, RotoHog developed an exclusive partnership with RazorGator that will allow RotoHog users to purchase tickets to live events through the global ticket reseller.
RotoHog has been the recipient of the following industry honors:

<doc id="15148822" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15148822" title="United Australian Automobile Industries">
United Australian Automobile Industries

United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI) was an automobile model sharing firm that operated in Australia between 1987 and 1996 as the result of an agreement between Holden (the Australian subsidiary of General Motors) and Toyota Australia. The joint venture resulted in the two companies sharing production of locally produced automobiles by selling their models under both brands.
UAAI produced three rebadged vehicles: the Holden Apollo (based on the Toyota Camry), Holden Nova (based on the Toyota Corolla) and Toyota Lexcen (based on the Holden Commodore).
The formation of UAAI can be traced back to the May 1984 announcement of the Button car plan, the work of Senator John Button, the Minister for Industry under the then current Bob Hawke led Labor government. The plan envisaged to rationalise and make the Australian automotive industry more competitive on a global scale by means of reducing import tariffs. Under an obligation to amalgamate, Holden and Toyota formed the UAAI joint venture on 11 December 1987 that resulted in model sharing between both automakers. These cars were released to the market in August 1989. As consistent with the government mandated plan, UAAI operated under the framework of coordinated design, engineering and product sharing whilst maintaining independent marketing operations and dealership networks. For Holden, it replaced the earlier joint venture with Nissan that had resulted in model sharing from 1984.
Toyota commenced manufacture of the Nova for Holden in June 1989 and the Apollo in July. Both companies held back certain marketing advantages to produce a greater level of model differentiation, for example the Toyotas were positioned as slightly more upmarket and equipment levels differed. Irrespective of this, many buyers could tell that the cars were merely rebadged versions of other cars available on the market, and sales figures generated by the disguised versions reinforced this. That is, the version of the car produced by the original manufacturer far surpassed the sales figures for the rebadged version.
Poor sales of the rebadged cars and an unwillingness to embrace the forced relationship led to dissolution of UAAI. This occurred in March 1996. Production ended later in the year, although a large enough stockpile remained for some vehicles to remain in showrooms until 1997.
Introduced in 1989, the Holden Apollo was basically a badge-engineered Toyota Camry sedan and station wagon. The second generation model was introduced in 1993 and remained in production until 1996.
The Holden Nova sedan and hatchback, like the Apollo arrived in dealerships in 1989 replacing the Holden Astra (LD), a joint development with Nissan also producing the Nissan Pulsar (N13). The Nova was a rebadged Toyota Corolla (E90) with the front panels, grille and headlamps from the Japanese-specification Corolla FX hatchback. This was a similar approach to the then contemporary Geo/Chevrolet Prizm sold in the United States and Mexico, which utilised E90 Sprinter panels to differentiate between GM and Toyota models. While the Nova was a Toyota design, the factory producing it in Dandenong, Victoria was a Holden factory closed in 1988 in preparation of production of the Corolla/Nova.
In 1994, Holden released the second generation Nova based on the Toyota Corolla (E100), now manufactured at Toyota's Altona, Victoria facility. Production ended in 1996.
The Toyota Lexcen reached Toyota dealerships in 1989, the same year that Toyota models arrived in Holden showrooms. The Lexcen was Toyota's version of the Holden Commodore, available in the same sedan and station wagon body styles, but only in the V6 engine and automatic transmission guise. The Holden however, was available with a V8 engine option, and had the availability of manual transmission for both the V6 and V8. Holden stopped supplying Toyota with the Lexcen in 1997.
By the end of 1993, the UAAI venture cars realised sales of 21 percent at best when compared to the models retailed by their original manufactures.
Nova production in 1992 totalled 3,697 units (16.6 percent of the Toyota Corolla figure); 3,016 Novas were manufactured in 1993 (12.6 percent), and in 1994 production amounted to 3,581 units (16.5 percent). Apollo production in 1992 totalled 4,490 units (17.5 percent of the Toyota Camry figure, excluding exports); 5,314 Apollos were manufactured in 1993 (18.2 percent), and in 1994 production amounted to 5,519 units (14.7 percent).

Bank of Khartoum

Bank of Khartoum (BOK), with some 66 or more branches, is the largest bank in Sudan. It is also the commercial bank with the oldest continuous history in the country. The largest single shareholder is Dubai Islamic Bank. In 2011 the government of the United States of America lifted its sanctions on Bank of Khartoum. The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control posted notice on its website that it had removed Bank of Khartoum from the blacklist, meaning Bank of Khartoum could seek the return of blocked assets and resume limited dealings with U.S. financial institutions. However, in March 2014, several European and Saudi Arabian banks announced that they would cease transacting with Bank of Sudan.
With the separation of South Sudan from Sudan, the Bank of Khartoum Juba (BOK-JUBA) is now operating as a commercial bank in South Sudan. 
The origins of the Bank of Khartoum date back to 1913 when the Anglo-Egyptian Bank established a branch in Khartoum. In 1925, Barclays Bank merged Anglo-Egyptian with two other banks to form Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas). 
After World War II, The Ottoman Bank in 1948 established a branch in Khartoum. fFive years later, Egypt's Bank Misr too established a branch in Khartoum, followed the next year by Jordan's Arab Bank. Then in 1958 the State Bank of Ethiopia (later Commercial Bank of Ethiopia), established a branch in Khartoum.
Eleven years later, in 1969, National and Grindlays Bank acquired the Ottoman Bank, only to lose it the next year to nationalization. In 1970 the Sudanese government nationalized all the banks in the Sudan, changed the names of several, and put them under the Bank of Sudan. Barclays Bank, which had an extensive network of 24 branches, became the State Bank of Foreign Trade, and then Bank of Khartoum in 1975. Bank Misr's six branches became People's Cooperative Bank. Arab Bank's four branches became Red Sea Bank or Red Sea Commercial Bank (reports differ). Commercial Bank of Ethiopia's one branch became Juba Commercial Bank. National and Grindlays Bank's four branches, which Ottoman Bank had established, became Omdurman Bank. Then in 1973 the government merged Red Sea Bank and People's Cooperative Bank into Omdurman Bank. 
Eleven years later, Omdurman Bank merged with the Juba Commercial Bank to form Unity Bank. In 1993, the government grouped Unity Bank, National Export Import Bank, and Bank of Khartoum into the Khartoum Bank Group. 
In 2002 the government prepared Bank of Khartoum for privatization. The government then sold a 60 per cent share toDubai Islamic Bank in 2005. The next year, Islamic Development Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, Sharjah Islamic Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank founded Emirates and Sudan Bank in Khartoum as a fully Islamic bank. The year after, Bank of Khartoum announced that it was merging with Emirates and Sudan Bank. The merger took effect in 2008.
Dubai Islamic's ownership will drop to 28 percent of the merged bank. The Sudanese government will own 10 percent of the bank, while Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and Sharjah Islamic Bank would also own stakes.

Midlands Co-operative Society

Midlands Co-operative Society Limited was the second largest consumer co-operative in the United Kingdom. It was a registered Industrial and Provident Society, a member of the Co-operative Union, the Co-operative Retail Trading Group and a corporate member of The Co-operative Group (formerly Co-operative Wholesale Society), the largest consumer co-operative in the world. The Society had a wide-ranging and extensive portfolio with over 200 stores, principally trading in the English Midlands. Head office was located in Lichfield, Staffordshire.
On 19 September 2013, it was announced that the boards of Midlands Co-operative Society and Anglia Regional Co-operative Society had agreed merger terms. Approved by members on 4 and 18 November, legal completion of the merger took place on 1 December, with the Anglia Society transferring engagements to Midlands Co-operative. On 15 January 2014, members of the merged society approved a change of name to Central England Co-operative effective from 25 January 2014.
The Society traced its origins to the Derby Co-operative Provident Society which, in 1854, was one of the first co-operatives in the Midlands. In 1969, a number of Leicestershire societies merged to form the Leicestershire Co-operative Society. Similar circumstances occurred in 1985 across Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Birmingham forming the Central Midlands Co-operative Society. In 1995, the boards of the Leicestershire and Central Midlands societies, which were financially sound and trading profitably, agreed to merge. Since 1854, 72 separate mergers between different societies were undertaken to form the Midlands Co-operative.
More recently, the Chesterfield Co-operative Society was absorbed by the Society in 2001, Ilkeston Co-operative Society in 2006, Raunds Co-operative Society in 2007, Moulton Co-operative Society in 2009 and Shepley Industrial and Provident Society in 2013.
On 1 December 2013, the Midlands Co-operative Society merged with Anglia Regional Co-operative Society. The combined Society began trading as Central England Co-operative with effect from 25 January 2014.
Membership was open to all residents of the Society's trading area, with members receiving a share of the profits in the form of dividend.
The Society operated over 200 food stores and forecourts throughout its trading area. All had been rebranded as The Co-operative Food, mirroring branding from The Co-operative Group.
Midlands Co-operative Funeral Services operated some 90 funeral homes throughout the region.
The Society no longer operates its department stores, having closed these in 2013.
The Society operated light-commercial vehicle servicing garages and MoT testing stations in Leicester and Loughborough. It also had a single Suzuki car franchise in Kettering, operating as The Co-operative Motor Group in Lincoln with Mazda, Citreon, Renault, Jeep, Chrysler and Harley Davidson franchises.

Eastern Coach Works

Eastern Coach Works was a bus and train bodybuilder based in Lowestoft, England.
The origins of Eastern Coach Works (ECW) can be traced back to 1912, when United Automobile Services was founded in Lowestoft to run bus services. United began a coach building business at the Lowestoft site in 1920. In 1931, the East Anglian operations of United were hived off into a new company, Eastern Counties Omnibus Company, and Eastern Counties inherited the coach works - now concentrating on building bus bodies, with a workforce of over 600 people. In July 1936, the coach works were separated into a new company, Eastern Coach Works Limited, which developed into the largest full-time employer in Lowestoft.
In May 1940, the factory received orders from the military authorities to cease production. It was thought that, following the outbreak of World War II, the East Coast would be the first target for an invading German army, so all wheeled vehicles were moved away from the site so that they did not fall into enemy hands. As a result of this, 950 staff were laid off with production shifted to Irthlingborough. By 1947, though, production was back to pre-war levels.
ECW was nationalised in 1947. For the next 18 years, its business consisted mainly of building bus bodies, which were mounted on Bristol chassis, for state-owned bus operators. In 1965, the state-owned Transport Holding Company sold a 25% share in ECW to Leyland Motors, which enabled ECW to sell to the private sector. During the 1960s, it was common to see a bare bus chassis being driven through town by a goggle-wearing driver, delivering the chassis for a body.
In 1969, ECW became part of a 50/50 joint venture between the National Bus Company (successor to the Transport Holding Company) and British Leyland (successor to Leyland Motors).
The materials to build the buses came into the Coachworks via Essex Road at the back of the factory, but the newly built buses were driven out of the big doors at the front. They drove down the short, narrow lane, with no pavements called Eastern Way, on their way to their new depot. Eastern Way used to be called Laundry Lane, but the name was changed to Eastern Way following the opening of Eastern Coachworks.
The joint venture came to an end in 1982, when British Leyland bought out NBC’s shareholding. ECW closed in January 1987. The site was subsequently demolished to make way for the North Quay Retail Park, which opened in 1990. ECW was one of Lowestoft's largest employers, with around 1,200 staff at its peak.
ECW was probably best known for its close association with Bristol Commercial Vehicles. Amongst the Bristol buses most frequently bodied at Lowestoft were the:

Elematic

Elematic Ltd is a Finnish company founded in 1959, which supplies precast concrete machinery and equipment, production lines and complete production plants worldwide. Elematic is in more than 100 countries, across five continents.
Toijalan Teräsvalmiste (TTV) began building machinery for the precast concrete industry in 1959. In 1969, TTV founded a German sister company Finn Elematic Baugeräte GmbH in Nidda, outside of Frankfurt.
The first ELEMATIC extruder was built in the early 1970s and sold to Partek (acquired by Kone in 2001), a Finnish cement and building materials manufacturer. In 1973 Partek acquired TTV, forming Partek Heavy Metal Industry with 400 employees. Finn-Elematic GmbH marketed ELEMATIC products in Germany and in other German-speaking countries.
In 1981 manufacturing and engineering were separated into own business units: Toijala Workshop for building machines and Elematic Engineering (EE) for engineering, marketing and selling. The separation became more formal as two limited liability companies Elematic Engineering Oy (1988) and Toijala Works Oy (1990) were formed. In 1984 Dy-Core Systems Inc (DC), a Canadian hollow-core machine manufacturer, was acquired by Elematic Engineering Oy.
In 1992 Partek and Lohja Parma Engineering (which had a subsidiary Induco GmbH, in Germany) began jointly restructuring their building material businesses. Both their precast manufacturing plants and technology units united to form Partek Concrete Engineering. In 1996 Partek Concrete Engineering acquired the business operations of Germany's Roth Machinenbau GmbH and combined it with existing operations in Nidda to form PCE Roth GmbH. The name of the parent company was officially changed to PCE Engineering Oy Ab (PCE).
More acquisitions were made during this period of strong growth:
In 2000 a customer service center was established for after-sale support.
PCE acquired ACOTEC Ltd in November 2001.
In 2003 PCE reverted to the old company name "Elematic", now as Elematic Oy Ab. In 2006, Elematic was acquired by several Finnish investors. Later that year Elematic Group acquired X-Tec Oy, a Finnish hollow-core slab machinery manufacturer.
In 2007 a Finnish investor group, led by private equity investor Sentica Partners, sold Elematic Group to a private equity fund managed by Pamplona Capital Management. The management of Elematic maintained their shareholdings.
In 2010s Elematic has expanded its business in Asia, Russia and Middle-East.
In 2014 Elematic opened new production facilities in Finland and in India.
In 2015 Elematic became a public limited liability company, Elematic Oyj (plc). The change is related to the issuance of a four-year secured bond in 2014.
As a global company Elematic has subsidiaries Elematic Inc. in the U.S. and Elematic GmbH in Germany, OOO Elematic in Russia,as well as the Elematic sales office and customer service center in Dubai, sales offices in China and Hong Kong. Warehouses for the spare and wear parts locate in Finland, Dubai/the UAE and the USA.
The main marketing areas of Elematic consist of the Middle East, the CIS, the Baltic Countries, and Western Europe. To the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain alone, Elematic has delivered twenty complete factories. Customer Service Center in Dubai is running machinery inspections, factory audits and training in the factories.
Elematic has five main product ranges: floor technologies, batching and mixing plants with concrete distribution systems, Acotec partition wall technology, various technologies for e.g. general precast concrete walls, facades, beams, columns, railway sleepers and others.

Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori

Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori () is an Italian company which is Europe's first private open access operator of high-speed trains. 
NTV was created by four Italian businessmen (among them Luca Cordero di Montezemolo) to compete with Trenitalia. The company intended to start services in late 2011, following certification of its trains in mid-2011. 
In March 2011, NTV complained that the Italian infrastructure manager, RFI, was obstructing its plans to run trains by making last-minute changes to network statements. RFI is controlled by the same government group that controls Trenitalia, the incumbent provider of passenger train services in Italy.
After delays due to the complexity of the project, NTV started service on 28 April 2012 under the .italo brand. 
NTV ridership for whole year 2012 was 2,051,702.
Ridership increased to 9.1 million in 2015, with a load factor of 71.5% and 56 trains daily.
An order for 25 Alstom Automotrice à grande vitesse (AGV) trainsets each with 11 cars was announced on 17 January 2008. Alstom assembled 17 at its La Rochelle plant, while eight were produced at Savigliano in Italy. NTV has an option for a further ten trains. The contract includes maintenance for 30 years. NTV unveiled the first of its trains in a ceremony on 13 December 2011.
In 2015, NTV announced the procurement of eight new trains to expand its fleet. The new units would be from Alstom's Pendolino family, with a maximum speed approximately 60 km/h slower than the existing AGVs. The procurement is intended to allow NTV to expand its existing "Italo" services, as well as offer services to new destinations.
Italo offers four classes of service, which it refers to as "journey ambiances". Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the train.
Routes served by NTV are those of the Italian high-speed rail network, comprising 13 cities and 16 stations. 
Italo’s High Speed train service contains four lines: 
In Turin, Rome and Venice there are two station options: Termini and Tiburtina stations in Rome, Mestre and Santa Lucia in Venice, Porta Nuova and Porta Susa in Turin, whereas in Milan there are three station options: Centrale, Porta Garibaldi and Rogoredo.

World Victory Road

World Victory Road (WVR) is a defunct Japanese Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) organization which promoted the Sengoku Raiden Championship (SRC) in Japan. The organization was formed in 2007 following the purchase of PRIDE FC by Zuffa. It operated in conjunction with the Japan Mixed Martial Arts Federation (JMM). The Sengoku championship was broadcast on Fuji TV and pay-per-view in Japan, and on HDNet in United States.
Beginning with the December 31 show, Sengoku was known as Sengoku Raiden Championship. "Raiden" means "thunder and lightning" and refers to a legendary 18th century sumo. WVR exec Kokuho said they hoped the initials "SRC" will be more palatable to international audiences.
On March 12, 2011, it was reported that Don Quijote, a Japanese discount store chain serving as the primary sponsor of the promotion, had ceased all funding to WVR. That same day, WVR officials issued a press release stating that barring the sudden emergence of a new primary sponsor, the promotion was effectively finished.
The promotion received a boost in visibility in their endeavor to compete with DREAM when it reached a broadcast agreement for Fuji TV to televise matches in Japan. It was significant given the fact that this is the first MMA promotion to be televised on the network since it dropped PRIDE FC from its lineup in mid-2006. The events will be shown live on Fuji TV 739 and then a two-hour version later in the night on Fuji TV.
On February 6, 2009, HDNet announced they had reached and agreement with WVR to broadcast its Sengoku-events in America starting March 20, 2009.
WVR's rules differ somewhat from the Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. Among the differences are the allowance of knees and stomps to the head of downed opponent while elbows to the head and soccer kicks are prohibited. Similar to the Unified Rules, fights have three rounds each lasting five minutes.

Westlake Recording Studios

Westlake Recording Studios is a music recording studio in West Hollywood, California.
Westlake Recording Studios was founded in the early 1970s by the American audio engineer Tom Hidley under the name Westlake Audio. Hidley was experienced in the development of audio technology, having collaborated with Madman Muntz in the development of the first car stereo in 1959, and along with Amnon "Ami" Hadani, he had previously set up another recording studio in Hollywood, TTG Studios, in 1965. The layout of the rooms at Westlake Studios aimed for an acoustic design that could give a fairly flat frequency response at the recording position, with low reverberation delay and extensive use of bass traps. As the need to transfer audio material between different studios grew, there was an increasing demand for standardization across the recording industry; the success of Hidley's acoustic design was copied at other sites, and "Westlake-style" rooms spread to a number of other studios by the late 1970s. Westlake has been credited as "one of the first big commercial efforts to produce acoustically standardised 'interchangeable' rooms".
Artists who have recorded music at Westlake Studios have included Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Quincy Jones, Bruce Swedien, Missy Elliott, Madonna, Marilyn Manson and Justin Timberlake. Notable recordings produced at Westlake Studios have included Michael Jackson's album, "Thriller" (April-November 1982), the number-one-selling album of all time; and Alanis Morissette's "Jagged Little Pill" (1994–1995).
Westlake Studios have also been used to produce audio material for films, television shows and commercials. In June 1980, National Public Radio, in a co-production with the BBC, used Westlake Studios to record a 13-part radio adaptation of "Star Wars". NPR returned to Westlake in 1996 to record its production of "Return of the Jedi".
Westlake has a total of seven recording studios, including four with full size live rooms, two production rooms and a mixing suite.
Studios A and B are located on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA and Studios C, D, E, Production Room 1 and Production Room 2 are located on Santa Monica Boulevard, CA in West Hollywood, CA.
Studio A is one of the most historic rooms at Westlake. The control room of Studio A features a 60-channel Neve V3 console and a tracking room, including a large piano isolation room. Studio A was where Michael Jackson's "Thriller" was recorded in 1982.
Studio B is a full size studio that features a 72-channel Solid State Logic 4072 G series console and a large selection of outboard gear. It has a tracking room and a isolation room.
Studio C is a full size studio that features a 72-channel Solid State Logic 9072 J series console and a large selection of outboard gear. It has a tracking room and a large private lounge.
Studio D is Westlake's largest room. It features a Solid State Logic XL 9000 K console and a large selection of outboard gear. The main tracking area is and there is a piano isolation room and a isolation room. Studio D has a private entrance and features 3 lounge areas including a loft that overlooks the tracking room.

Staveley Coal and Iron Company

The Staveley Coal and Iron Company Limited was an industrial company based in Staveley, near Chesterfield, North Derbyshire. The company was registered in 1863, appearing in provincial stock exchange reports from 1864. It exploited local ironstone quarried from land owned by the Duke of Devonshire on the outskirts of the village. It developed into coal mining, owning several collieries and also into chemical production, first from those available from coal tar distillation, later to cover a wide and diverse range. Part of the plant at Staveley was a sulphuric acid manufacturing unit making use of the Contact Process.
It was during the years of World War 1 that the company developed its chemical operations beyond coal-tar chemicals and began production of sulphuric and nitric acids. During the war they also made picric acid, TNT and guncotton. Following the end of hostilities the company laid plans to develop a range of chlorinated organics and to this end purchased salt-bearing land near Sandbach, Cheshire. The salt was produced by a new company formed specifically for the purpose and named the British Soda Company. The salt being needed to feed a new installation of mercury cells at the Staveley works. The first cells at Staveley came into operation in 1922 and in 1926 they went into partnership with the Krebs Company of Paris and Berlin to develop a new cell, which was based on lessons learned. This was marketed worldwide as the Krebs-Staveley cell. This installation lasted into the late 1950s when the cellroom at Staveley was replaced with German-made mercury cells.
Another salt-related product was sodium chlorate. Staveley Coal and Iron Company were the first company in Britain to manufacture this chemical, with the plant becoming operational in 1938. In 1950, the Staveley Iron and Chemical Company was named by Imperial Chemical Industries as one of their main competitors in caustic soda production.
In 1960 the Staveley Iron and Chemical Company, which had been taken over by Stewarts & Lloyds Limited was merged with the Ilkeston-based Stanton Iron Works to form Stanton and Staveley Ltd. In 1967 Stewarts and Lloyds became part of the nationalised British Steel Corporation, Stanton and Staveley also being incorporated.
By 1980 BSC sold off sections of the site as they divested themselves of non-core activities and by 2007 most of the former works at Staveley has been shut down and cleared. The only plant remaining now is a p-aminophenol plant that produces active ingredients for paracetamol production. The site ceased production in June 2012, marking over 100 years of chemical production at Staveley. The worldwide brand of Staveley Chemicals has finally been laid to rest. The site has since been demolished.
The former Chesterfield MP Eric Varley was an apprentice with the company in leaving school before he became a trade union man and then latter became Chairman of another local firm Coalite.

Bollack Netter and Co

Bollack, Netter, et Cie "()", more commonly known as B.N.C., was a small automobile company in Paris situated on Avenue de Paris 39, in the Levallois-Perret district.
B.N.C. was established by Lucien Bollack (an engineer who had also worked for Hispano-Suiza) and his financier, banker René Netter, in January 1923. The technical director was Jacques Muller, also known as "Jack". Muller's earlier J.M.K. cyclecar formed the basis of their first car the "DZ".
B.N.C. were a successful maker of cyclecars, winning many rallies albeit not selling very many cars. In the late 1920s, the company tried to penetrate a higher market sector - unfortunately the demand for large passenger cars and for ultra-light racing cars were both low, and Bollack and Netter were forced out of their company in 1928 when the business was acquired by Charles de Ricou, an energetic businessman who by now had a reputation for rescuing financially troubled automobile manufacturing businesses. In the case of B.N.C. his timing was less than perfect, however, in that (like many others) he failed to anticipate the Great Depression, B.N.C. launching the large 8-cylinder engined "Aigle" in October 1929, a few days before the stock market crashes gave notice of a decade of severe contraction and stagnation for the French economy.
Shortly after he had taken over at B.N.C., de Ricou took over two other companies in financial difficulty, Lombard and Rolland-Pilain; Charles de Ricou took a double stand, directly opposite one of the principal entrances of the Grand Palais, at the 25th Paris Motor Show in October 1931, and displayed on it cars from all three of his companies, B.N.C., Lombard and Rolland-Pilain. Models on display included the new B.N.C. 6-cylinder engined 2-litre B.N.C coupé "Vedette ADER". In the event this car was never produced for sale, however.
For 1931 a line of sporty front-wheel drive B.N.C. cars with pneumatic suspension were presented but came to naught. The doors of the firm were shuttered shortly afterwards.
One of B.N.C.'s drivers, André Siréjols, had already been building special bodies for B.N.C. cars. He took over the remaining stock of parts and kept on assembling a trickle of cars into the fifties, usually referred to as "B.N.C. Siréjols". The last of these continuation cars were equipped with Ford's "10 HP" 1172 cc side valve four.
Beginning with a single model, the DZ, before the first year was over the range had reached double digits. Three chassis and three different engines were offered, as were a plethora of bodystyles.
B.N.C. mainly produced sports cars, and their design was similar to that of the Amilcar. The cars' engines were not made at the factory, but were instead purchased from proprietary engine manufacturers such Ruby (927 cc) and S.C.A.P. (900 cc). B.N.C. later produced a car with a 1,100 cc S.C.A.P. or Chapuis-Dornier engines, fitted with a Cozette supercharger. While most had three-speed gearboxes, a number of cars received four-speed units. In 1927 the B.N.C. Sport was presented, with overhead-valve engines from S.C.A.P. or Ruby, spoked wheels, and a strongly inclined radiator. In the late 1920s, BNC tried their hand at producing large passenger cars (the "Aigle") with four to five-liter eight-cylinder engines made by Lycoming.
To prove the mettle of the cars, a standard B.N.C. with an 1,100 cc Ruby engine lapped the (then unpaved) Le Mans circuit for 24 hours straight in 1928. The average speed was above .
After having been forced out of the company, Lucien Bollack retained the import rights to the American Lycoming engines. He went on to manufacture the large Lycoming-engined (again of four or five liters) Aigle in 1929. Only a very few were built, however (possibly only a single example), and the company had ceased trading by 1930.
The firm's greatest victory was a double win at Fontainebleau (with lady racer Violette Morris at the wheel of the winning car), at the 1927 "Bol d'Or".
In 1928 a BNC finished in seventh place at Le Mans. At the 1929 Le Mans 24 hour race the manufacturer entered three cars. Two were powered by 995cc engines and retired from the race early on. The third was a 1500cc car and covered 88 laps before retiring: this car attracted attention for another reason, since it featured an imposing vertical radiator-grill at the front rather than a sloping grill of the style that by this time had become a standard feature of BNC track cars.
In 1930, a B.N.C. won its class at the Spa 24 Hours race. The following year, while leading its class, the engine broke down a few hours before the finish and the car ended up in thirteenth place, with Duray and Charlier driving. B.N.C. cars are also still used in rallies.

Snappy Tomato Pizza

Snappy Tomato Pizza is a pizza chain that started in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, and has over 60 locations nationwide. Its headquarters are in Burlington, Kentucky. The chain specializes in pizza, but also serves calzones, hoagies, salads, pasta, dessert and appetizers.
The first Snappy Tomato Pizza was opened by Robert Rotunda in Fort Mitchell in 1978. Rotunda went to a horse race and put all of his money on a horse named “Snappy Tomato.” The horse won and Rotunda took all of his winnings and opened the first Snappy Tomato Pizza restaurant. In 1981 the company began franchising. In 1993, Snappy Tomato Pizza was purchased by Charles H. Deters.
Snappy Tomato has bought two other pizza franchises. Those two include a Cincinnati-based pizza franchise, “Spooners Pizza” in 1993, and seven Louisville, KY based franchises, “Pizza Magia” in 2005.
There are several dozen locations operating in the Greater Cincinnati area, and elsewhere in Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Missouri, and Mississippi. Most stores are within the Southeastern United States. However, in 2009 Snappy Tomato Pizza ventured out west and opened up in Clovis, New Mexico.

<doc id="15186541" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15186541" title="Permian Basin Royalty Trust">
Permian Basin Royalty Trust

The Permian Basin Royalty Trust () is a United States oil and natural gas royalty trust based in Dallas, Texas. With a market capitalization of US $790,000,000, and an average daily trading volume of about 186,000 shares at the end of 2007, it is one of the largest royalty trusts in the United States. Its source of revenue is oil and gas pumped from the geologic formation for which it is named, the Permian Basin in west Texas, as well as a few locations in other parts of the state.
Most of the Trust's properties are on the Waddell Ranch in Crane County, Texas, where it owns a 75% net overriding royalty interest in the fee mineral interests (in this case, oil and natural gas). Other properties of the trust are in 32 other Texas counties, most of which are in the western portion of the state, on the High Plains; the trust owns a 95% net overriding royalty interest in all of its properties outside of the Waddell Ranch.
The principal productive zones for oil on the Waddell Ranch are in two geologic units, the Grayburg and the San Andreas, at a depth of from 2,800 to below ground surface; however there are a total of 12 producing zones on the ranch, including one at a depth of . As of the end of 2006, there were a total of 800 operational and productive oil wells and 205 natural gas wells on the Waddell Ranch in the Trust. On December 31, 2006, the Trust claimed a lifetime of approximately 8.3 years for all mineral reserves of the Trust.
Permin Basin Royalty Trust came into being in November 1980, with an agreement between Southland Royalty Company and the First National Bank of Fort Worth. As is the case with U.S. royalty trusts, the trust cannot function as a business, and has no employees; all operations and maintenance are carried out by the Trustee and its subcontractors. Currently, the assets of the Trust are managed by ConocoPhillips, which acquired Meridian Oil, the previous operator. Meridian changed its name to Burlington Resources Oil and Gas Company, LP, in 1996, prior to being acquired by ConocoPhillips in 2006.
The Trust pays a relatively high dividend, yielding an annual rate of 12.4% in early 2008; in addition, it pays out monthly, a relative rarity for U.S. stocks. However, its distribution is dependent on the prices of oil and gas; thus, unlike traditional stocks (who, when declaring a dividend, usually maintain it at the same amount for each quarter of the year), the dividend payout will differ each month.
Since the Trust's assets are considered a depletable resource, its dividend payments are not taxed at the regular dividend rate, but rather as return of capital instead of return on investment; this is an additional tax advantage in the United States, and applies to all royalty trusts.

Café Britt

Café Britt is a Costa Rican company that produces gourmet coffee, fine chocolate and specialty gift items. They have 140 gift stores in ten countries (in Latin America, the Caribbean, Australia and the United States) and an online store. They create and sponsor coffee-related tourism and education in Costa Rica.
The company employs nearly 1,000 people. Many of the 92 coffee-and-gift stores it owns and operates are located in international airports. Its coffee-roasting and chocolate-making operations are based in Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia.
North American coffee broker Steve Aronson founded the company in 1985 to market roasted Costa Rican coffees to the domestic market. It was the first gourmet coffee roaster in the country; At the time most of the best coffee was exported to foreign markets, Aronson decided to promote the idea that good quality should also be consumed locally. The name "Britt" is a tribute to Scandinavian countries which are one the largest consumers of coffee; the name was chosen after Aronson opened a contest to pick a name.
The company expanded its operations with the introduction of chocolates in 2000, as well as opening its first store at Juan Santamaría Airport in 2001. In 2003 it added further stores at various hotels popular with tourists in Costa Rica. In 2005 new stores were opened in Perú, the Caribbean, and Chile. In 2009 the company announced plans to open its own coffee roasting plant in Cancún, México in order to avoid the high import tariffs imposed by México on foreign coffees. After 25 years at the helm, Steve Aronson yielded his position as president to his son, Phillipe in 2009.
In 1991, Café Britt started to combine coffee with tourism with the introduction of the "Britt Coffee Tour", a play staged in its own coffee plantation, traces coffee’s production cycle. Some 50,000 people take the tour each year. More technically oriented versions of the tour have been developed for visiting coffee experts or serious amateurs.

Carson Helicopters, Inc is a helicopter operating company based in Perkasie, Pennsylvania, United States. Carson operates a fleet of Sikorsky S-61 helicopters in aerial lift services and aerial firefighting. Carson is best known for the 2008 crash that killed seven firefighters and two pilots. Former VP Steve Metheny was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in prison for falsifying documents that led to the crash. Mr. Metheny went to great lengths after the crash to attempt to conceal the fraud. When he knew that investigators would be examining the company’s operations, he directed other employees to remove weight from other similar helicopters, including taking off a fuel cell and replacing a very heavy battery with an empty shell of a battery. Some of the employees refused to participate in that deception, with one explaining that he was done lying about the helicopter’s weight.

Workfront

Workfront is a Lehi, Utah-based software company that develops web-based work management and project management software that features enterprise work management, issue tracking, document management time tracking and portfolio management. The company was founded in 2001 by Scott Johnson. Workfront has 670 employees and approximately 4,000 customers with offices in the United States and EMEA.
In 2015, the company was renamed from AtTask to Workfront and opened a new headquarters in Utah. Workfront’s customers include companies such as Cars.com, Cisco Systems, Comcast, Food and Drug Administration and National Geographic. The company’s software has been implemented by Emerson and the State of Arkansas court system to standardize project management process including collaboration and document control.
In 2001, entrepreneur Scott Johnson had an idea for a software package that would allow companies to better manage workflow and communication. After having a workable version of his software, he founded AtTask, along with Abe Knell, Jason Fletcher and Nate Bowler. In July 2001, AtTask released @task, a project management tool designed for businesses. The nascent company was boot-strapped and funded in part by a second mortgage Johnson took out on his home.
Johnson decided to completely rewrite the company's project management platform in 2003. The rewritten version of @task was finished and released in 2006. Joseph Cardenas joined AtTask’s board of directors in April 2007. Prior to joining AtTask, Cardenas served as a partner at Counterpoint Advisers and CIO of Salesforce.com.
In June 2007, AtTask received $7 million in funding from OpenView Venture Partners. The $7 million investment equaled more than twice AtTask's 2006 revenue. OpenView's investment was the first outside investment accepted by AtTask. OpenView invested an additional $6.5 million in December 2009.
In 2011, Eric Morgan replaced founder Scott Johnson as president and CEO of AtTask. Johnson became chairman of AtTask.
In November 2012, AtTask raised $17 million in venture capital in a funding round led by Greenspring Associates. The company raised an additional $38 million in a January 2014 funding round led by JMI Equity. The 2014 funding round was their fourth and included an additional investment by Greenspring Associations. The company announced a 50 percent year-over-year subscription growth rate.
In 2012, a team of five employees was formed to research interest with marketing teams leading the company to expand the team and grow the marketing growth segment.
In 2015, AtTask was renamed to Workfront. Workfront raised a $33 million Series E funding led by JMI Equity along with investments from Greenspring Global Partners and Atlas Peak in 2015. The company has raised a total of $95 million in venture capital to date. In that same year, Workfront acquired online proofing vendor and partner ProofHQ, a London-based provider of online proofing software. The acquisition integrated over 350 joint clients between the two companies, however, ProofHQ continues to be sold separately.
Workfront developed a Game of Thrones-themed infographic for mobile phone etiquette, which used humor to show statistics of the most common office communication pitfalls and office attitudes toward common witnessed behaviors. The concept was built upon the “seven houses” of the workplace: multitasking, awkwardness, carelessness, courtesy, over-calling, non-communication and obliviousness. In 2014, the company received a B2B Oscar for Best Call to Action for its humorous video, “The Working Dead.”
On July 5th, 2016, Workfront announced that Alex Shootman would serve as CEO. That same year, the company was named to "Forbes" inaugural Cloud 100 List and included on the Deloitte Fast 500 list for the fourth consecutive year. 
Workfront conducted a survey that showed top causes for workplace stress were excessive workloads and competing deadlines, a lack of communication and visibility into the work done by others on the team and poor access to resources to complete work. The survey showed that among the 526 marketing professionals, four out of five employees experienced burn out and 73 percent expected a rise in work stress levels. In addition to stress, 72 percent of the industry professionals reported office tension as a contributor to stress levels and that they were overloaded and understaffed. Those surveyed believed that employers could remedy their stress by providing structures and tools to create a support system, having more involvement in decision-making and more contact with management, and implementing training on how to productively structure the work day.
In 2014, Workfront conducted a study on workplace productivity and found that American employees on average only spend 45 percent of their work time on what they were hired to do. The 2,000 survey participants, listed inefficient meetings and excessive emails as interruptions. Another 36 percent reported that a lack of process keeps them from completing their responsibilities and 35 percent mentioned excessive oversight. The study discovered that 81 percent of those surveyed experienced workplace conflict with other departments, groups, teams, or co-workers which resulted in loss of productivity. 
In 2015, a study conducted by Workfront on UK office workers, found that those working as marketers were the hardest working, the study also found that these workers were more likely to suffer from digital-overload. The study also found that 58% of marketers made New Year's resolutions based around their work, in contrast to the 35% for other office workers. 
Another survey of 2,500 UK office workers examined the differences in skill-sets and attitudes between different generations of workers. The study found that Millennials complained the most, but were seen as the most tech savvy. The study also found that members of Generation X were viewed as the hardest workers, most helpful and best troubleshooters.
In 2016, Workfront conducted a State of Enterprise Work Report that found American marketers who work at large companies spent only 39 percent of their work time doing the job they were hired for. The 606 participants cited meetings, excessive oversight, emails and administrative tasks as key obstacles kept them from performing their primary role. The survey also found that 84 percent of respondents loved their jobs despite working a slightly longer than average workweek and taking shorter lunches than their non-marketing counterparts. Workfront also conducted a nearly identical study in the U.K. with very similar results.
Workfront provides a software-as-a-service platform for enterprise workflow management, project and portfolio management, resource management and individual task management. Workfront's platform automates repeatable processes and allows users to manage financial information and create reports. The platform is used for task management and has tools for document management, workflows, reports, dashboards and approvals.
The Workfront Enterprise Work Cloud is a project management tool used to increase productivity and visibility. The platform is used by global enterprises such as Disney, Tommy Hilfiger, ATB Financial, and Trek Bicycle. In 2016, Workfront added an extension that allows for integration with the Adobe Creative Cloud.
In 2015, Workfront launched a non-intrusive digital asset management (DAM) space allowing marketing teams to manage collaboration, brand management, and asset control with efficiency. The digital asset management solution was added to the enterprise workflow platform to help marketers store, use and reuse digital assets for an efficient workflow and integration between DAM and the work management ecosystem.

Unican Security Systems

Unican Security Systems Ltd. was a Canadian-based company created by Aaron Fish in the 1960s and sold in 2000. At its sale (to Kaba Group), the company had over $800 million in sales annually and was the largest maker of key blanks and key copying machines in the world.
Aaron Fish was born in the 1930s in Montreal, Quebec. He was the Chairman and CEO of Unican Security Systems Ltd. from its creation in 1965 to its sale in December 2000. He worked for his father in his early years as a locksmith. By the time he was 17 and had graduated from high school, he was operating as a key and lock distributor. From 1949 to 1960, Fish became the largest key and lock distributor in Montreal.
In 1960 Bell Canada decided they needed to get away from using keys, and had a requirement for a push button lock. Fish then promptly moved from being a distributor to a being a developer, and created the first push button lock in North America. In 1964, in an effort to finance his company, Unican, he sold half of the business to private investors.
In 1967 Fish once again ran out of money, he took his company public to raise a quarter of a million dollars. Over the next 4 years Unican acquired 5 companies, from die casting Capitol Industries to key-maker Ilco in Boston. During the 1980s, the company grew exponentially, achieving sales of $100 million annually. In the 1990s, Unican Security Systems was supplying locks to the U.S. Pentagon and the United Nations.
By 1999, the company had sales of nearly $500 million annually, making 4.5 million keys each day for automobile companies, hotels, residential, commercial and the like.
In December 2000, Unican Security Systems was bought out by the Kaba Group of Switzerland for $36.00 a share based on 18 124 000 shares outstanding. Unican's fortunes declined following the 2000 sale, as global competition increased. In November 2007, Fish bought back the original east-end Montreal plant where the company began. He began slashing costs and soon returned Capitol Industries Ltd. to profitability. The Montreal Gazette on Sept. 6, 2008 reported that the company now specializes in zinc die-casting and finishing, mainly for metal furniture parts such as door handles.
Fish was responsible for a major change in the key making and lock industries in North America, Europe, South America and Asia. Peter Blaikie was a major supporter of the company.
In June 2016, Fish was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Concordia University, making this his first degree since graduating high school.

Tokaido (company)

Tokaido's founder, Shizuo Sugiura, was a martial arts enthusiast who would watch demonstrations and competitions of many Japanese martial arts. With time, he became increasingly interested in the art of karate. At the time, karate practitioners would simply use judo uniforms or other clothing for training. Judo emphasizes grappling, so training in that art typically requires a strong, heavy uniform; karate emphasizes striking, so training in that art does not require so heavy a uniform. Sugiura was already working in the clothing industry, and decided to combine his work with his interest in karate by producing uniforms specifically for karate training.
In 1958, Sugiura established the Tokaido company. Its name means "Eastern Sea Shop" in Japanese, and comes from the name of Sugiura's home region on the east coast of Honshū island. Sugiura began supplying sample uniforms to instructors of the newly formed Japan Karate Association (JKA), and used their feedback to improve the designs and manufacturing. The JKA helped popularize the Tokaido brand amongst Shotokan karate practitioners; the karate masters who appear in Masatoshi Nakayama's series of "Best Karate" textbooks were wearing Tokaido uniforms.
Tokaido produces two main styles of karate uniform: a standard version used more for regular training and "kata" (patterns) competition, and a heavier version used more for "kumite" (sparring) competition. The uniforms and belts are cut and sewn by hand. Apart from uniforms and belts, the company provides embroidery of Japanese words (such as individual practitioners' or karate schools' names) and rank markings, and also produces badges and labels matching major karate organizations. Tokaido has also produced custom-made uniforms made by master tailors Genzo and Waisetsu. These items are available only to karate practitioners ranked 3rd "dan" or higher.
The company is owned and operated by the Sugiura brothers, sons of the founder. It has headquarters in Kōjimachi, a suburb of Tokyo, and a factory in Nagoya. Tokaido has an international office in the United States of America, and several offices and sales outlets in Japan.
a. More completely, the company's name in Japanese is , which indicates that it is a specific type of company under Japanese corporate law.
b. Others have attempted to profit from the company's reputation by producing fake Tokaido uniforms. At least one retailer has published a guide to distinguishing between real and fake Tokaido uniforms.

Meson Sandwiches is a fast-casual restaurant chain that primarily sells sandwiches, salads and breakfast items, which it serves all day long. Based in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico El Meson Sandwiches is Puerto Rico’s largest restaurant chain. In 2012 it was named one of the world’s top fast food chains by "Travel & Leisure" magazine.
El Meson Sandwiches is family owned and operated. It has 37 locations in Puerto Rico and one in Orlando, Florida in Florida Mall which opened in June 2015. The company plans to open four more locations in Orlando by 2017 including one in Kissimmee at The Crossing shopping center which will open by the end of 2015.
El Meson plans to begin franchising in 2018. El Meson Sandwiches units average $2 million in sales per year. System-wide sales in 2015 were just under $80 million.
Products
El Meson sandwiches are mostly served on criollo bread, a sweet, French-style bread with a Caribbean flavor. Most are pressed on a hot grill and served with cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. The Delicioso sandwich comes with turkey and bacon. The White House is grilled with roast beef, turkey and mushrooms. El Meson also serves sandwiches on baked potatoes.
History
The first El Meson Sandwiches opened in 1972 in the beach town of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico’s northwestern tip. The restaurant was started by Felipe Perez Sr., father of the current CEO, Felipe Pérez Grajales. The original restaurant was known primarily for two things: home-style sandwiches and a familial atmosphere.
Many of El Meson’s early customers were American surfers who came early in the day asking for big, healthy breakfasts. Their requests prompted Perez Sr. to create a sandwich dubbed The Surfer, which comes stuffed with fresh vegetables and soy-based protein. The second Puerto Rico location opened in 1987, shortly after the younger Perez returned from college in Jacksonville, Florida. Rapid growth followed.
About Felipe Pérez Grajales
Felipe Pérez Grajales is the current CEO of El Meson Sandwiches. He was born in 1965, the eldest of three brothers. From the early 1970s through his high school years, Grajales worked in the original El Meson restaurant in Aguadilla. In 1983 he left Puerto Rico to attend Jacksonville University. Though he received several offers from companies in the U.S., he returned to Puerto Rico in 1986 to help expand the family business.
Grajales has been recognized as an outstanding businessman by Ernst & Young, the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce, the Sales & Marketing Executives (SME) Association, and the House of Representatives and Senate of Puerto Rico.
He was president of the Organizing Committee for the XXI Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayagüez in 2010 and is president of the Mayagüez 2010 Foundation.

ESS Technology

ESS Technology Incorporated is a private manufacturer of computer multimedia products, Audio DACs and ADCs based in Fremont, California with R&D centers in Kelowna, BC Canada and Beijing, China. It was founded by Forrest Mozer in 1983. Robert L. Blair is the CEO and President of the company.
Historically, ESS Technology was most famous for their line of their Audiodrive chips for audio cards. Now they are known for their line of Sabre DAC and ADC products.
ESS Technologies was founded in 1983 as Electronic Speech Systems, by Professor Forrest Mozer, a space physicist at the University of California, Berkeley and Todd Mozer, Forrest Mozer's son, and Joe Costello, the former manager of National Semiconductors Digitalker line of talking chips. Costello left soon after the formation and started Cadence Designs with his former boss from National. Fred Chan VLSI designer and software engineer, in Berkeley, California, joined in 1985, and took over running the company in 1986 when Todd Mozer left for graduate school.
The company was created at least partially as a way to market Mozer's speech synthesis system (described in US patents 4,214,125, 4,433,434 and 4,435,831) after his (3-year, summer 1978 to summer 1981, extended) contract with National Semiconductor expired in 1983 or so.
Electronic Speech Systems produced synthetic speech for, among other things, home computer systems like the Commodore 64. Within the hardware limitations of that time, ESS used Mozer's technology, in software, to produce realistic-sounding voices that often became the boilerplate for the respective games. Two popular sound bites from the Commodore 64 were "He slimed me!!" from "Ghostbusters" and Elvin Atombender's "Another visitor - Stay a while, stay forever!" in the original "Impossible Mission".
At some point, the company moved from Berkeley to Fremont, California. Around that time, the company was renamed to ESS Technology.
Later, in 1994, Forrest Mozer's son Todd Mozer, an ESS employee, branched off and started his own company called Sensory Circuits Inc, later Sensory, Inc. to market speech recognition technology.
In the mid-1990s, ESS started working on making PC audio, and later, video chips, and created the Audiodrive line, used in hundreds of different products. Audiodrive chips were at least nominally Creative Sound Blaster Pro compatible. Many Audiodrive chips also featured in-house developed, OPL3-compatible FM synthesizers (branded ESFM Synthesizers). These synthesizers were often reasonably faithful to the Yamaha OPL3 chip, which was an important feature for the time as some competing solutions, including Creative's own CQM synthesis featured in later ISA Sound Blaster compatibles, offered sub-par FM sound quality. Some PCI-interface Audiodrives (namely the ES1938 Solo-1) also provided legacy DOS compatibility through Distributed DMA and the SB-Link interface.
In 2001 ESS acquired a small Kelowna design company (SAS) run by Martin Mallinson and continues R&D operations in Kelowna. The Kelowna R&D Center developed the Sabre range of DAC and ADC products that are used in many audio systems and cell phones.
Forrest Mozer continues his research work at the University of California, these days as Associate Director of Space Sciences. He was awarded EGU Hannes Alfven Medallist 2004 for his work in electrical field measurement and space plasma and also was involved in building the microphone to record sounds from the Mars Lander. He is a member of the board of directors of Sensory, Inc.
Fred Chan held a number of positions at ESS, and was CEO of Vialta, an internet offshoot of ESS, until his stepping down on July 18, 2007, to pursue philanthropic interests.
Most recently, ESS Sabre DACs were used in the LG V10 smartphone, with a quad DAC in the V10's successor V20.
Many products are quoted from Steve Foskett's site. Others are referred to on an SEC form filed by ESS.
ESS1868 AudioDrive 
Professor Mozer first became interested in speech technology when a blind student in his class in 1970 asked whether he could help design a talking calculator. Mozer spent 5 years working on it, and his speech technology first appeared in the Telesensory Systems "Speech+" talking calculator, in a chip called the "CRC Chip", more commonly known as s14001a, the first self-contained speech synthesizer chip. This chip was also used in a few arcade games, notably Atari's Wolf Pack, and Stern Electronics' Berzerk and Frenzy, and in several of Stern's pinball machines.
After a three-year exclusive deal with Telesensory Systems from 1975 to 1978, Forrest Mozer sold a 3-year license to National Semiconductor, and they created another chip using Mozer synthesis, the MM54101 "Digitalker". At first, even then, all words were encoded by hand by Mozer in his basement, but in the third or fourth year of the license, National came up with a software encoder for it. After the exclusive license expired (National seemed to have a "non-exclusive" license for a year or so), Mozer licensed the technology to ESS. After Mozer's son Todd split off and created Sensory Circuits Inc., the technology was licensed there.
According to the Sensory Inc. history pages and old datasheets, they offered three types of compression:
and a few other PCM/LPC based systems.
Although Sensory bought up the Texas Instruments' speech products, their main focus has been on speech recognition, and not synthesis.
Professor Mozer's technique not only produced very realistic sounding speech, it also required very little on-chip (later, in software) RAM, a sparse and expensive commodity at that time. The advanced compression algorithm (patented, an early form of psychoacoustic compression using similar spectra of ADPCM-encoded waves) reduced the memory footprint of speech about a hundredfold, so one second of speech would require 90 to 625 bytes. With ESS-speech, samples that would normally require almost all of the 64 kilobyte memory of the Commodore 64 (if encoded in PCM) were so small, that the entire game fit into the RAM along with speech, without requiring additional loads from disk.

Dräxlmaier Group

Dräxlmaier Group is a German automotive component supplier active in auto electric, interiors, plastics, toolmaking and logistics. Founded in 1958, the family run enterprise is nowadays one of the biggest component supplier within Germany, running 58 sites in 22 countries on 4 continents. The Headquarters of the Dräxlmaier Group is based in Vilsbiburg, Lower Bavaria, Germany.
The Dräxlmaier Group has such renowned customers as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Jaguar and Bugatti.
Dräxlmaier Group was founded in May 1958 in Vilsbiburg, Germany by Lisa and Fritz Dräxlmaier. Their first order is for 50,000 wire harnesses for the Goggomobil manufactured by Hans Glas GmbH. A short time later, another order followed for the interior (door panels, upholstery, instrument panels, rear deck). Soon the company gained foothold in the business, and in 1960
Dräxlmaier installed its first facilities for high-frequency welding and thermoplastic vacuum molding for interior business.
The company's product lineup expanded rapidly during its first six years. Plans for a new factory, already on the drawing board in 1962, become a reality in 1964 as the company opened its first 2,400 square-meter manufacturing facility. It began production of polyurethane foam components. In 1966 BMW became a new customer of Dräxlmaier Group.
Ten years after its founding, the company had evolved internally as well. It opened its own tool and die shop and introduced its first EDP system. At first, the system was used only to process warehouse transactions but soon it is handling accounting as well. During the next 3 years the company kept on growing and expanding. Audi, Volkswagen and Mercedes Benz became new customers and the headquarters in Vilsbiburg was extended, opening a new building for manufacturing and administration. 1974 The cornerstone is laid for globalization as the first manufacturing facility in Tunisia opens its doors and two years later even expanded to America as the first German OEM opens a manufacturing facility in the United States. Growth at home requires the entire plastics division to move to Geisenhausen. Operations now take up some 17,000 square meters.
Operations continued to expanded after 25 years of dynamic growth, expanding from one company to six, from a staff of ten to 1,300. In the year 1983 a great educational initiative launches, with a record number of 46 vocational trainees. The president of Germany thanks Dräxlmaier "for exemplary service in providing job training to young people".
The group incorporated to keep pace with growth, giving rise to Lisa Dräxlmaier GmbH and Eldra Kunststofftechnik GmbH. Four new foreign affiliates took up operations and a centralized EDP network linked the entire company. In 1987 Dräxlmaier's typical supply chain took shape with construction of its automated high-rise parts warehouse. The warehouse anticipated the trend to just-in-time/customer-specific wire harnesses. The high-rise warehouse (enlarged several times since then) has been the basis of all the logistical structures which have been key to Dräxlmaier's dynamic growth.
In 1988 the company celebrated its 30th anniversary and Fritz Dräxlmaier received the "Bayerischer Verdienstorden" on behalf of the approximately 3,400 employees from Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss.
The concept of customer-specific wire harnesses provided the catalyst for the rapid transition from a Lower Bavarian group of companies to an international enterprise. Dräxlmaier became the first supplier capable of reacting to customers' mass-production needs by manufacturing and delivering customized electrical systems in lot size 1 and just in sequence. Customer-specific wire harnesses became a reality for all three major customers - Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi - within the space of a single year.
In 1993 Dräxlmaier Group started expansion into the former East Bloc by entering Czechoslovakia and Romania. The following year Dräxlmaier won out over international mega-suppliers in a concept competition. The task of designing, manufacturing and delivering the entire cockpit for the Mercedes-Benz CLK (C208) made Eldra a system supplier of interiors.
In 1995 Fritz Dräxlmaier, Sr. died at 80 years of age. In the words of Minister of Economics August R. Lang, the company lost one of "Lower Bavaria's most prominent entrepreneurs". Two years later the "Firmengruppe Dräxlmaier" was rechristened "Dräxlmaier Group" "(DRX)". In the same year the company won a concept competition sponsored by BMW for the E65 door module as a "Functionally Integrated System" (FIS). The FIS order for the BMW 7 Series was the first design order for a door module. An order for FIS center consoles soon followed. Both modules for the BMW 7 Series were manufactured just in sequence and delivered to the OEM line in Dingolfing.
Dräxlmaier obtained control of HIB Holzindustrie Bruchsal GmbH. The acquisition allows Dräxlmaier to add premium wood trim to its product lineup. The Dräxlmaier Technology Center opened its doors the same year. The ultramodern architecture supports the entire process chain and houses modeling, tool and die, prototype facilities and SEP. The following year Dräxlmaier got to be the first system supplier to manufacture a full leather interior for the Mercedes-Benz CL Coupe. In 2000 the Dräxlmaier Group receives the "Formula Q" quality prize from Volkswagen, awarded to the 20 best suppliers for absolute reliability, high quality and zero defects, etc. This follows on the heels of various other prizes awarded by different OEM partners. In the same year, DRX designed and manufactured the complete Interior for the BMW Z8, the first order of this magnitude from BMW. Porsche, Jaguar and Cadillac are won over as new customers. In 2002 DRX supplies interiors for the Maybach luxury limousine. Dräxlmaier was responsible for the entire electrical system, the interior and the fine wood trim.
During the years 98 – 08 new facilities and plants open in Achim, China and Mexico, San Luis Potosí.
In 2010, Dräxlmaier Group sold the business unit HIB (Holzindustrie Bruchsal), which produces wooden trims elements, to the subsidiary Mutares AG, including the stakes in Vilsbiburg and Codlea in Romania.
In July 2012 the company announced that it will open a new production facility in Kavadarci, Macedonia and that will employ up to 4,000 people. This is Dräxlmaier's first plant in Macedonia. The Macedonian subsidiary managed to employ more than 6,000 by 2016.
Dräxlmaier Group accompanies the manufacturing process right from the drawing board to series production, designing and manufacturing the complete electrical system, interiors and door modules to customer specifications.
The company has 58 production sites in 22 countries on 4 different continents.
Qestronic is a subsidiary enterprise of Dräxlmaier Group. It was founded on July 2009 and is located in Geisenhausen, Lower Bavaria, Germany. The company produces components and total systems, digital electronics, high-voltage energy storage and complete E-mobility solutions.

<doc id="15232287" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15232287" title="Reliance Power">
Reliance Power

Reliance Power Limited is part of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. It was established to develop, construct and operate power projects in the Indian and international markets. Reliance Infrastructure Limited, an Indian private sector power utility company and the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group promote Reliance Power.
The company is the sole distributor of electricity to consumers in the suburbs of Mumbai. It also runs power generation, transmission and distribution businesses in other parts of Maharashtra, Goa and Andhra Pradesh.
With its subsidiaries, it is developing 13 medium and large-sized power projects with a combined planned installed capacity of 33,480 MW.
Reliance Natural Resources merged with Reliance Power in 2010, shortly after its initial public offering.
The company was incorporated in January 1995 as Bawana Power Private Limited and changed its name to Reliance Delhi Power Private Limited in February 1995. Its name was changed to Reliance Energy Generation Limited in March 2004, and finally to Reliance Power Limited in July 2007.
The company website identifies project sites broadly to be located in western India (12,220 MW), northern India (9,080 MW) and northeastern India (4,220 MW) and southern India (4,000 MW). They include six coal-fired projects (14,620 MW) to be fuelled by reserves from captive mines and supplies from India and abroad, two gas-fired projects (10,280 MW) to be fuelled primarily by reserves from the Krishna Godavari basin (the "KG Basin") off the east coast of India, and four hydroelectric projects (3,300 MW), three of them in Arunachal Pradesh and one in Uttarakhand.
Distribution
Anil Dhirubhai Ambani placed a single order for $8.3 billion with Shanghai Electric Group Company (SEC) for buying 36 coal-fired thermal power generation units, spare parts and related services over a 10-year period. This took the total deal size between Reliance Power and the Chinese power equipment maker over the past couple of years to $10 billion, making it the largest contract between a private Indian company and a government-owned Chinese firm.
While Reliance Power has also given a $2.2 billion deal to US-based General Electric, the agreement signed with SEC is on a different plane. The Chinese company will supply boiler, turbine and generator packages for up to 30,000 MW capacity of coal-based power at six plants, including the 4000 MW ultra mega power project in Krishnapatnam, the 3960 MW Project in Chitrangi and the 4000 MW Power Project in Tilaiya.
Reliance Power Ltd. signed an agreement with the US Export-Import Bank in 2010 for a $5 billion loan to finance power projects. The loan will finance 900 megawatts of renewable technologies such as solar and wind energy, as well as up to 8000 MW of gas-based power generation technology, the Indian company said in a statement. This $5 billion agreement is in addition to the $917 million already approved by the Ex-Im Bank for Reliance Power's coal-fired power plant at Sasan in central India.
The agreement will allow Reliance Power access products and services at competitive rates and help create manufacturing and services jobs in the US. The loan will also enable quicker access to the bank's long-term dollar loans. Reliance Power signed a pact with the US's General Electric Co. (GE) worth INR100 billion ($2.2 billion) to implement a 2400 MW power plant. The plant will be located in the southern Indian town of Samalkot and the pact was signed during the visit of President Barack Obama.
On 15 January 2008, the company attracted $27.5 billion of bids on the first day of its initial public offering (IPO), equivalent to 10.5 times the stock on offer, thereby, creating India's IPO record. The upper cut off price for the bid was Rs. 450 The proposed IPO was to fund the development of its six power projects across the country whose completion dates are scheduled from December 2009 to March 2014.
A media report suggested that, if the company’s stock price were to cross Rs. 650–700, Anil Ambani would go past L. N. Mittal to become the richest Indian. "It is a reflection of world community in the future of India... Investors seem to be confident in the future of Indian economy," Indian Finance Minister, P. Chidambaram told the media about the IPO.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India, which is an organisation that regulates the activity in the Indian stock market, placed some restrictions based on a complaint about the formulation of the IPO. The complaint also resulted in a public interest litigation being filed against the company. However, the Supreme Court of India passed a ruling that the IPO would go ahead even if any order is passed by any Indian court against the venture.
Reliance Power debuted on the stock markets on 11 February 2008. However, the markets were still reeling after the January 2008 stock market volatility, and concerns over speculation that the issue was overpriced sent the stock plummeting soon after its listing. At the end of the day, the stock traded at a value that was 17 per cent lower than its issue price of Rs. 450 . Investors who were betting on the stock reaching 1.5 or even twice its issue price lost a fortune in the process. On 25 February, in an effort to mitigate investor losses, Reliance Power decided to issue 3 bonus shares for every 5 shares held.
On 2 February 2011 United Nations registered Reliance Power's Sasan Power Plant to be eligible for earning carbon credits followed by Krishnapatanm Ultra Mega Power Project and Tilaiya Ultra Mega Power Projects. United Nations issues carbon credits to companies which employs advanced technologies in reducing carbon emission . These carbon credits can then be sold to those companies that are emitting more than their statutory emission limits.

Firmly established in the civil engineering sector at the start of the 1990s, Barr looked to broaden its skillbase by developing its portfolio in building projects. During the next decade, Barr developed its skills across a number of core sectors. These sectors included Retail, Leisure and Education. The current structure has evolved to reflect the organisation’s strengths in these sectors.
The company is best known perhaps for its stadia work which includes new facilities for Southampton, Fulham, Celtic, and Rangers Football Clubs as well as projects for lower league and rugby clubs. The projects at Airdrieonians and Raith Rovers excited controversy when the resulting debts to Barr Construction caused financial problems for the clubs.
In 2001 the company won the contract to upgrade the A830 road between Mallaig and Fort William in the Scottish highlands. Barr were also involved in the renovation of Home Park, the stadium home to English football club, Plymouth Argyle F.C.
In 2006 Barr built the first "eco-store" for Tesco at Wick in Scotland, using the unorthodox method of ship transport to deliver building materials to the site in order to save on carbon emissions.
In 2007 the company was bought by McLaughlin & Harvey.
For the 2012 London Olympic games, Barr won the contact to construct the Olympic Park Basketball arena.
In November 2014 McLaughlin & Harvey integrated Barr Construction into its business and Barr Construction ceased to exist as a separate business, although the Barr name continues to be used within the group for Barr Environmental.
